<p><span class="u"><b><i>BY THE SAME AUTHOR.</i></b></span></p>


<p class="ph2">WHEN I WAS CZAR.</p>

<p>The <i>Court Circular</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;There is always something supremely
audacious about Mr. Marchmont&#8217;s books. This, however, I will say,
that for a long evening&#8217;s solid enjoyment &#8216;When I was Czar&#8217; would be
hard to beat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Nottingham Guardian</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The best story of political intrigue
which has been written since &#8216;The Prisoner of Zenda,&#8217; with which it
compares for the irresistible buoyancy by which it is told and the skill
in which expectation is maintained on tiptoe till the last move.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Freeman&#8217;s Journal</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;A very brilliant work, every page
in it displays the dramatic talent of the author and his capacity for writing
smart dialogue.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">AN IMPERIAL MARRIAGE.</p>

<p>The <i>Sporting Life</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;Every page is full of incident and bright
dialogue. The characters are strongly and vividly drawn, and the development
of the whole story shows the author to be a thorough master of his
craft.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Scotsman</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The action never flags, the romantic element is
always paramount, so that the production is bound to appeal successfully
to all lovers of spirited fiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Notts Guardian</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The interest is absorbing and cumulative
through every chapter, and yet the tale is never overloaded with incident.
The vigour and reality of the story does not flag to the last page.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Court Journal</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;One of those intricate webs of intrigue and
incident in the weaving of which the author has no equal.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">BY SNARE OF LOVE.</p>

<p>The <i>Dundee Courier</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;To say that the clever author of &#8216;When
I was Czar&#8217; has eclipsed that stirring romance is to bring one within the
sphere of the incredible. But it is true. The present novel is full to
overflowing of boundless resource and enterprise, which cannot but
rouse even the most blas&eacute; of readers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The story is undoubtedly clever. Mr. Marchmont
contrives to invest his most improbable episodes with an air of
plausibility, and the net result is an exciting and entertaining tale.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Birmingham Post</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Marchmont creates numerous
thrilling situations which are worked out with dramatic power, his description
of the interior of a Turkish prison, with all its horrors, being a
realistic piece of work.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">IN THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i>:&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Marchmont&#8217;s tales always have plenty of go. He
is well up to his standard in this busy and exciting narrative.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Globe</i>:&mdash;&#8220;Mr. A. W. Marchmont can always write an exciting
story bristling with adventures and hazard, and incidents of all sorts.
&#8216;In the Cause of Freedom&#8217; furnishes a good example of his talent. Vivid,
packed with drama, with action that never flags, this novel ought to
appeal successfully to all lovers of romantic and spirited fiction.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>People&#8217;s Saturday Journal</i>:&mdash;&#8220;It is an admirable example of the
type of exciting fiction for which Mr. Marchmont is justly famous, and
lacks nothing in the way of plot and incident.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">THE QUEEN&#8217;S ADVOCATE.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;Written in a vigorous and lively manner,
adventures throng the pages, and the interest is maintained throughout.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Belfast Northern Whig</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;As one book follows another
from Mr. Marchmont&#8217;s pen we have increased breadth of treatment, more
cleverly constructed plots and a closer study of human life and character.
His present work affords ample evidence of this.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Madam</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;A thrilling story, the scene of which takes us to the
heart of the terrible Servian tragedy. We are taken through a veritable
maze of adventure, even to that dreadful night of the assassination
of the Royal couple. A very readable story.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">A COURIER OF FORTUNE.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;An exciting romance of the &#8216;cloak
and rapier.&#8217; The fun is fast and furious; plot and counterplot, ambushes
and fightings, imprisonment and escapes follow each other with
a rapidity that holds the reader with a taste for adventure in a state of
more or less breathless excitement to the close. Mr. Marchmont has a
spirited manner in describing adventure, allowing no pause in the doings
for overdescription either of his characters or their surroundings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Bristol Mercury</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;A very striking picture of France at a
period of absolute social and political insecurity. The author&#8217;s characters
are drawn with such art as to make each a distinct personality.
&#8216;A Courier of Fortune&#8217; is quite one of the liveliest books we have read.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">BY WIT OF WOMAN.</p>

<p>The <i>Morning Leader</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;A stirring tale of dramatic intensity, and
full of movement and exciting adventure. The author has evolved a
character worthy to be the wife of Sherlock Holmes. She is the heroine;
and what she did not know or could not find out about the Hungarian
Patriot Party was not worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Standard</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;Mr. Marchmont is one of that small band of
authors who can always be depended upon for a distinct note, a novel
plot, an original outlook. &#8216;By Wit of Woman&#8217; is marked by all the
characteristic signs of Mr. Marchmont&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>


<p class="ph2">THE LITTLE ANARCHIST.</p>

<p>The <i>Sheffield Telegraph</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;The reader once inveigled into starting
the first chapter is unable to put the book down until he has turned over
the last page.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Manchester City News</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;It is no whit behind its predecessors
in stirring episode, thrilling situation and dramatic power. The story
grips in the first few lines and holds the reader&#8217;s interest until &#8216;finis&#8217; is
written.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>Scotsman</i> says:&mdash;&#8220;A romance, brimful of incident and arousing
in the reader a healthy interest that carries him along with never a pause&mdash;a
vigorous story with elements that fascinate. In invention and workmanship
the novel shows no falling off from the high standard of Mr.
Marchmont&#8217;s earlier books.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;<i>September 20, 1907</i>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MY DEAR MURIEL,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here at last, and the above is my address.
The <i>Stella</i> dropped her anchor in the Tagus
yesterday afternoon, and within half an hour I was
at the Visconte de Linto&#8217;s house. That will show you
I mean my campaign to be vigorous. But the Visconte
and his wife are at Coimbra, and Miralda is with them.
I should have been off in pursuit of her by the first
train; but I managed to find out that they are with
friends there and will be back to-morrow for a big
reception. As that is just the sort of place I should
choose before all others for the meeting with Miralda,
I promptly set to work to get an invitation. I have
done it all right. I got it through that M. Volheno
whom you and Stefan brought on a visit to us at Tapworth,
just after I got home from South Africa. Tell
Stefan, by the way, that Volheno is quite a big pot
and high in the confidence of the Dictator. I told
him, of course, that I had come here about the mining
concessions in East Africa; and I shall rub that in
to every one. I think his mouth watered a bit at the
prospect of getting something for himself; anyway,
he was awfully decent and promised me all sorts of a
good time here. Among the introductions he mentioned
was one to the de Lintos! I kept my face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
as stiff as a judge&#8217;s; but I could have shrieked. Imagine
a formal introduction to Miralda! &#8216;Mademoiselle
Dominguez. Mr. Donnington,&#8217; and those eyes of
hers wide with astonishment, and her lips struggling
to suppress her laughter! I really think I must let him
do it, just to see her face at the moment. Anyway,
I shall see her to-morrow night. Ye gods! It&#8217;s
over four months since I fell before her beauty as
intuitively as a pagan falls before the shrine of the
little tin god he worships. I hope no one has got in
the way meanwhile; if there is any one&mdash;well, I&#8217;ll do
my best to give him a bad time. I&#8217;m not here for my
health, as the Yanks say; nor for the health of any
other fellow. By all of which you will see I am in good
spirits, and dead set on winning.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, I hear that things are in the very
devil of a mess in the city; and Volheno told me&mdash;unofficially
of course&mdash;that the streets are positively
unsafe after dark. But I was out for a couple of hours
last night, renewing my acquaintance with the city,
and saw no ripple of trouble. After his warning I
shoved a revolver in my pocket; but a cigar-holder
would have been just as much good. I should rather
like a scrap with some of the Lisbon ragamuffins.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken a furnished flat here; yacht too awkward

</div>

<p>I have given this letter because it explains the
circumstances of my presence in Lisbon. A love
quest. In the previous March, my sister&#8217;s husband,
Stefan Madrillo, who is on the staff of the Spanish
Embassy in Paris, had introduced me to Miralda
Dominguez&mdash;the most beautiful girl in Paris as she was
generally acknowledged; and although up to that
moment I had never cared for any woman, except my
sister, and the thought of marriage had never entered
my head, the whole perspective of life was changed on
the instant.</p>

<p>The one desire that possessed me was to win her
love; the one possible prospect which was not utterly
barren and empty of everything but wretchedness,
was that she would give herself to me for life.</p>

<p>I had one advantage over the crowd of men whom the
lodestone of her beauty drew round her. I had lived
in her country, spoke her language as readily as my
own, and could find many interests in common.
Naturally I played that for all it was worth.</p>

<p>From the first moment of meeting I was enslaved by
her stately grace, her ravishing smile, her soft, liquid,
sympathetic voice, the subtle but ineffable charm of
her presence, and the dark lustrous eyes into which
I loved to bring the changing lights of surprise, curiosity,
interest and pleasure.</p>

<p>I was miserable when away from her; and should
have been wholly happy in her presence if it had not
been for the despairing sense of unworthiness which
plagued and depressed me. She was a goddess to
me, and I a mere clod.</p>

<p>For three weeks&mdash;three crazily happy and yet
crazily miserable weeks for me&mdash;this had continued;
and then I had been wired for at a moment&#8217;s notice,
owing to my dear father&#8217;s sudden illness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>I had to leave within an hour of the receipt of the
telegram, without a chance of putting the question
on which my whole happiness depended, without even
a word of personal leave-taking. And for the whole of
the four months since that night I had had to remain in
England.</p>

<p>During nearly all the time my father lay hovering
between life and death. At intervals, uncertain and
transitory, he regained consciousness; and at such
moments his first question was for me. I could not
think of leaving him, of course; and even when the
end came, the settlement of the many affairs connected
with the large fortune he left delayed me a further
two or three weeks.</p>

<p>My sister assured me that, through some friend or
other, she had contrived to let Miralda know something
of the facts; but this was no more than a cold
comfort. When at length I turned the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> head
toward Lisbon, steaming at the top speed of her powerful
engines, I felt how feeble such a written explanation,
dribbling through two or three hands and watered
down in the dribbling process, might appear to Miralda,
even assuming that she had given me a second thought
as the result of those three weeks in Paris.</p>

<p>But I was in Lisbon at last; and although I could
not help realizing that a hundred and fifty obstacles
might have had time to grow up between us during the
long interval, I gritted my teeth in the resolve to
overcome them.</p>

<p>Anyway, the following night would show me how
the land lay; and, as anything was better than suspense,
I gave a sigh of relief at the thought, and having
posted the letter to my sister, set off for another prowl
round the city.</p>

<p>I had not been there for several years&mdash;before I
went out with the Yeomanry for a fling at the Boers&mdash;and
it interested me to note the changes which had
taken place. But I thought much more of Miralda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
than of any changes and not at all of any possible
trouble in the streets. After a man has had a few
moonlights rides reconnoitring kopjes which are likely
to be full of Boer snipers, he isn&#8217;t going to worry himself
grey about a few Portuguese rag-and-bobtail with
an itch for his purse.</p>

<p>Besides, I felt well able to take care of myself in any
street row. I was lithe and strong and in the pink of
condition, and knew fairly well &#8220;how to stop &#8217;em,&#8221;
as Jem Whiteway, the old boxer, used to say, with a
shake of his bullet head when he tried to get through
my guard and I landed him.</p>

<p>But my contempt for the dangers of the streets was
a little premature. My experiences that night were
destined to change my opinion entirely, and to change
a good many other things too. Before the night was
many hours older, I had every reason to be thankful
that I had taken a revolver out with me.</p>

<p>It came about in this way. I was skirting that
district of the city which is still frequently called the
Mouraria&mdash;a nest of little, narrow, tortuous by-ways
into which I deemed it prudent not to venture too far&mdash;and
was going down a steep street toward the river
front, when the stillness was broken by the hoarse
murmur of many voices. I guessed that some sort of a
row was in the making, and hurried on to see the fun.
And as I reached a turning a little farther down, I
found myself in the thick of it.</p>

<p>A small body of police came tearing round the
corner running for their lives with a crowd of men at
their heels, whooping and yelling like a pack of hounds
in full sight of the fox.</p>

<p>As the police passed, one of them struck a vicious blow
at me with a club, and I only just managed to jump
back and escape the blow. I drew into the shelter
of a doorway as the mob followed. The street was
very narrow and steep at this point, and the police,
seeing the advantage it gave them, rallied to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
stand some forty or fifty yards up the hill above
me.</p>

<p>The foremost pursuers paused a few moments to let
a good number come up; and then they went for the
police for all they were worth. The fight was very
hot; but discipline told, as it will; and although
the police were tremendously outnumbered, they held
their ground well enough at first.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the racket kept bringing up reinforcements
for the mob, and some of them began to get
disagreeably curious about me. Here was a glorious
struggle going on against the common foe, and I was
standing idly by instead of taking a hand in it.</p>

<p>One or two of them questioned me in a jeering tone,
and presently some fool yelled out that I was a spy.
From taunts and gibing insults, those near me proceeded
to threats, fists and sticks were shaken at me,
and matters looked decidedly unpleasant.</p>

<p>I kept on explaining that I was a foreigner; but that
was no more than a waste of breath; and I looked about
for a chance to get away.</p>

<p>I was very awkwardly placed, however. If I went
up the street, I should only run into the thick of the
fight with the police; while the constant arrival of
freshcomers below me made escape in that direction
impossible.</p>

<p>Then came a crisis. One excited idiot struck at
me with a stick, and of course I had to defend myself;
and for a time I was far too busy to heed what was going
on in the big row higher up the street. I tried fists
at first and, putting my back to the wall, managed to
keep the beggars at bay. Then a chance came to
seize a big heavy club with which a little brute was
trying to break my head; and with that I soon cleared
quite a respectable space by laying about me
indiscriminately.</p>

<p>But suddenly the club was knocked out of my hands,
and a howl of delight hailed my discomfiture. Then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
remembered my revolver. I whipped it out and a
rather happy thought occurred to me. Shouting at
the top of my lungs that I was an Englishman and
had nothing to do with either the mob or the police, I
grabbed hold of the ringleader of my assailants, and
used him as a sort of hostage. Keeping him between
myself and the rest, I shoved the barrel of the revolver
against his head and sung out that I would blow out
his brains if any other man attempted to harm me.</p>

<p>The ruse served me well. The crowd hung back;
and my prisoner, in a holy scare for his life, yelled
at his friends to leave me alone.</p>

<p>Whether the trick would have really got me out
of the mess I don&#8217;t know. There was not time to
tell, for another development followed almost immediately.
Some fresh arrivals came up yelling that
the soldiers were close at hand; and we soon heard
them.</p>

<p>The mob were now caught between two fires. The
police were still holding their own above us, and the
troops were hurrying up from the other direction.
Some one had the wit to see that the crowd&#8217;s only
chance was to carry the street against the police and
clear that way for flight. A fierce attack was made
upon them, therefore, and they were driven back to
one side, leaving half the roadway clear.</p>

<p>The throng about me melted away, and I let my
prisoner go, intending to wait for the troops. But
I soon abandoned that idea; for I saw they had clubbed
their muskets and were knocking down everybody they
saw.</p>

<p>I had already had a blow aimed at me by the police,
and had been threatened by the mob; and being in
about equal danger from both sides, I was certain to
get my head cracked if I remained. Their tactics were
to hit first and inquire afterwards, and I therefore
adopted the only alternative and took to my heels.</p>

<p>Being among the last to fly I was seen. A tally-ho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was raised and four or five of the police came dashing
after me. Not knowing the district well, I ran at top
speed and bolted round corner after corner, haphazard,
keeping a sharp look-out as I ran for some place in
which I could take cover.</p>

<p>I had succeeded in shaking off all but two or three
when, on turning into one street, I spied the window of
a house standing partly open. To dart to it, throw it
wide, clamber in, and close it after me took only a few
seconds; and as I squatted on the floor, breathing
hard from the chase and the effects of my former tussle,
I had the intense satisfaction of hearing my pursuers
go clattering past the house.</p>

<p>That I might be taken for a burglar and handed over
to the police by the occupants of the house, did not
bother me in the least. I could very easily explain matters.
It was the virtual certainty of a cracked pate, not
the fear of arrest from which I had bolted; and that I
had escaped with a sound skull was enough for me for
the present.</p>

<p>But no one came near me; so I stopped where I
was until the row outside had died down. It seemed
to die a hard death; and I must have sat there in the
dark for over an hour before I thought of venturing
out to return to my rooms.</p>

<p>Naturally unwilling to leave by the window, I groped
my way out into the passage and struck a match to
look for the front door. Close to me was a staircase
leading to the upper rooms; and at the end of the
passage a second flight down to the basement.</p>

<p>Like so many houses in Lisbon this was built on
a steep hill, and guessing that I should find a way out
downstairs at the back, I decided to use that means of
leaving, as it offered less chance of my being observed.</p>

<p>I had just reached the head of the stairway, when a
door below was unlocked and several people entered
the house. A confused murmur of voices followed, and
among them I heard that of a woman speaking in a tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
of angry protest against some mistake which those
with her were making.</p>

<p>The answering voices were those of men&mdash;strident,
stern, distinctly threatening, and mingled with oaths.</p>

<p>Then the woman spoke again; repeating her protest
in angry tones; but her voice was now vibrant with
rising alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221;</p>

<p>The command broke her sentence in two, and her
words died away in muffled indistinctness, suggesting
that force had been used to secure obedience.</p>

<p>Then a light was kindled; there was some scuffling
along the passage; and they all appeared to enter a
room.</p>

<p>I paused, undecided what to do. The thing had a
very ugly look; but I had had quite enough trouble
to satisfy me for one night. I didn&#8217;t want to go
blundering into an affair which might be no more than a
family quarrel; especially as I was trespassing in the
house.</p>

<p>A few seconds later, however, came the sound of
trouble; a blow, a groan, and the thud of a fall.</p>

<p>I caught my breath in fear that the woman had
been struck down.</p>

<p>But the next instant a shrill piercing cry for help
rang out in her voice, and this also was stifled as
if a hand had been clapped on her mouth.</p>

<p>That decided things for me.</p>

<p>Whatever the consequences, I could not stop to
think of them while a woman was in such danger as
that cry for help had signalled.</p>

<small>DEVELOPMENTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY view of the trouble was that it was a case
of robbery. The disordered condition of the city
was sure to be used by the roughs as a cover
for their operations; and I jumped to the conclusion
that the woman whose cry I was answering had
been decoyed to the house to be robbed.</p>

<p>But as I ran down the stairs I heard enough to
show me that it was in reality a sort of by-product
of the riot in the streets. The woman was a prisoner
in the hands of some of the mob, and they were
threatening her with violence because she was, in their
jargon, an enemy of the cause of the people.</p>

<p>To my surprise it was against this that she was
protesting so vehemently. Her speech, in strong
contrast to that of the men, was proof of refinement
and culture, while the little note of authority which
I had observed at first suggested rank. It was almost
inconceivable, therefore, that she could have anything
in common with such fellows as her captors.</p>

<p>The door of the room in which they all were stood
slightly ajar, and as I reached it she reiterated her
protest with passionate vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad. I am your friend, not your enemy.
I swear that. One of you must know Dr. Barosa.
Find him and bring him here and he will bear out every
word I have said.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Holding my revolver in readiness, I entered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough of that. Lies won&#8217;t help you,&#8221;
came the reply in the same gruff bullying tone I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
heard before. &#8220;Now, Henriques,&#8221; he added, as if
ordering a comrade to finish the grim work.</p>

<p>Holding my revolver in readiness, I entered. There
were three of the rascals. Two had hold of the
woman who knelt between them with her back to me,
while the third, also with his back to me, was just
raising a club to strike her.</p>

<p>They were so intent upon their job and probably
so certain that no one was in the house, that they did
not notice me until I had had time to give the fellow
with the club a blow on the side of the head which
sent him staggering into a corner with an oath of
surprise and rage. The others released their hold of
the woman, and as I stepped in front of her, they fell
away in healthy fear of my levelled weapon.</p>

<p>They were the reverse of formidable antagonists;
rascals from the gutter apparently; venomous enough
in looks, but undersized, feeble specimens; ready to
attack an unarmed man or a defenceless woman, but
utterly cowed by the sight of the business end of my
revolver.</p>

<p>They slunk back toward the door, rage, baulked
malice and fear on their ugly dirty faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;A spy! A spy!&#8221; exclaimed the brute who had
the stick; and at the word they felt for their knives.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put your hands up, you dogs,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;The
man who draws a knife will get a bullet in his
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the woman had scrambled to her feet,
with a murmured word of thanks to the Virgin for
my opportune intervention, and then to my intense
surprise she put her hand on my arm and said in a
tone of entreaty: &#8220;Do not fire, monsieur. They
have only acted in ignorance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hear that, you cowardly brutes,&#8221; I said,
without turning to look at her, for I couldn&#8217;t take
my eyes off the men. &#8220;Clear out, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and I
stepped toward them as if I meant to fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>In that I made a stupid blunder as it turned out.
They hung together a second and then at a whisper
from the fellow who appeared to be the leader, they
suddenly bolted out of the room, and locked the door
behind them.</p>

<p>Not at all relishing the idea of being made a prisoner
in this way, I shouted to them to unlock the door,
threatening to break it down and shoot them on
sight if they refused. As they did not answer I picked
up a heavy chair to smash in one of the panels, when
my companion again interposed.</p>

<p>But this time it was on my and her own account.
&#8220;They have firearms in the house, monsieur. If you
show yourself, they will shoot you; and I shall be
again at their mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke in a tone of genuine concern and, as I
recognized the wisdom of the caution, I put the chair
down again and turned to her.</p>

<p>It was the first good square look I had had at her,
and I was surprised to find that she was both young
and surpassingly handsome&mdash;an aristocrat to her
finger tips, although plainly dressed like one of the
people. Her features were finely chiselled, she had
an air of unmistakable refinement, she carried herself
with the dignity of a person of rank, and her eyes,
large and of a singular greenish brown hue, were bent
upon me with the expression of one accustomed to
expect ready compliance with her wishes. She had
entirely recovered her self-possession and in some
way had braided up the mass of golden auburn hair,
the dishevelled condition of which I had noticed in
the moment of my entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are probably right, madame,&#8221; I said; &#8220;but
I don&#8217;t care for the idea of being locked in here while
those rascals fetch some companions.&#8221;</p>

<p>I addressed her as madame; but she couldn&#8217;t be
more than four or five and twenty, and might be much
younger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;There will be no danger, monsieur,&#8221; she replied in
a tone of complete confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;There appeared to be plenty of it just now; and
the sooner we are out of this place, the better I shall
be pleased.&#8221; And with that I turned to the window
to see if we could get out that way. It was, however,
closely barred.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may accept my assurance. These men have
been acting under a complete misunderstanding. They
will bring some one who will explain everything to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Barosa, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know of him?&#8221; The question came
sharply and with a touch of suspicion, as it seemed
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, except that I heard you mention him
just as I entered.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused a moment, keeping her eyes on my face,
and then, with a little shrug, she turned away. &#8220;I
will see if my ser&mdash;my companion is much hurt,&#8221; she
said, and bent over the man who was lying against the
wall.</p>

<p>I noticed the slip; but it was nothing to me if she
wished to make me think he was a companion instead
of a servant.</p>

<p>She knew little or nothing about how to examine
the man&#8217;s hurt, so I offered to do it for her. &#8220;Will
you allow me to examine him, madame? I have been
a soldier and know a little about first aid.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made way for me and went to the other end of
the room while I looked him over. He had had just
such a crack on the head as I feared for myself when
bolting from the troops. It had knocked the senses
out of him; but that was all. He was in no danger;
so I made him as comfortable as I could and told her
my opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be all right, no doubt,&#8221; was her reply,
with about as much feeling as I should have shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
for somebody else&#8217;s dog; and despite her handsome
face and air of position, I began to doubt whether he
would not have been better worth saving than she.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did all this happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little impatient start at the question, as
if resenting it. &#8220;He was brought here with me,
monsieur, and the men struck him,&#8221; she replied after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But why were you brought here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet thanked you for coming to my
assistance, monsieur,&#8221; she replied irrelevantly. &#8220;Believe
me, I do thank you most earnestly. I owe you
my life, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an easy guess that she found the question
distasteful and had parried it intentionally; so I
followed the fresh lead. &#8220;I did no more than I hope
any other man would have done, madame,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the sort of reply I should look for from an
Englishman, monsieur.&#8221; Her strange eyes were
fixed shrewdly upon me as she made this guess at my
nationality.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am English,&#8221; I replied with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad. I would rather be under an obligation
to an Englishman than to any one except a countryman
of my own.&#8221; She smiled very graciously, almost
coquettishly, as if anxious to convince me of her absolute
sincerity. But she spoilt the effect directly.
Lifting her eyes to heaven and with a little toss of
the hands, she exclaimed. &#8220;What a mercy of the
Virgin that you chanced to be in the house&mdash;this house
of all others in the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood. She wished to cross-examine me.
&#8220;You are glad that I arrived in time to interrupt
things just now?&#8221; I asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; Eyes, hands, lithe body, everything
backed up the tone of surprise that I should question
it. &#8220;Do I not owe you my life?&#8221; I came to
the conclusion that she was as false as woman of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
her colour can be. But she was an excellent
actress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me suggest that we speak quite frankly.
Let me lead the way. I am an Englishman, here in
Lisbon on some important business, and not, as the
doubt underneath your question, implies&mdash;a spy.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; she cried again as if in almost horrified
protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was caught in the thick of a street fight,&#8221; I
continued, observing that for all her energetic protest
she was weighing my explanation very closely. &#8220;And
had to run for it with the police at my heels. I saw a
window of this house standing partly open and scrambled
through it for shelter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a blessed coincidence for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be simpler to say, madame, that you
do not believe me,&#8221; I said bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but on my faith&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me put it to you another way,&#8221; I cut in. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much of the ways of spies, but if I were
one I should have contented myself with listening at
that door, instead of entering, and have locked you
all in instead of letting myself be caught in this silly
fashion.&#8221; Then I saw the absurdity of losing my
temper and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>She drew herself up. &#8220;You are amused, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One may as well laugh while one can. If my laugh
offends you, I beg your pardon for it, but I am laughing
at my own conversion. An hour or two back I was
ridiculing the idea of there being anything to bother
about in the condition of the Lisbon streets. Since
then I have been attacked by the police, nearly torn to
pieces by the mob, had to bolt from the troops,
and now you thank me for having saved your life and
in the same breath take me for a spy. Don&#8217;t you
think that is enough cause for laughter? If you have
any sense of humour you surely will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;I did not take you for a spy, monsieur,&#8221; she replied
untruthfully. &#8220;But you have learnt things while
here. We are obliged to be cautious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good lady, how on earth can it matter? We
have met by the merest accident; there is not the
slightest probability that we shall ever meet again;
and if we did&mdash;well, you suggested just now that you
know something of the ways of us English, and in
that case you will feel perfectly certain that anything
I have seen or heard here to-night will never pass my
lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not mentioned your name, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph Donnington. I arrived yesterday and
stayed at the Avenida. Would you like some confirmation?
My card case is here, and this cigar case
has my initials outside and my full name inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need anything of that sort,&#8221; she cried
quickly, waving her hands. But she read both the
name and the initials.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you inferred from what you have seen
here to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the rascals who brought you here are some
of the same sort of riff-raff I saw attacking the police
and got hold of you as an enemy of the people. I
heard that bit of cant from one of them. That you
are of the class they are accustomed to regard as their
oppressors was probably as evident to them as to me;
and when you expressed sympathy with them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard that?&#8221; she broke in earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, when I heard you tell them to fetch
this Dr. Barosa. But it is nothing to me; nor, thank
Heaven, are your Portuguese politics or plots. But
what is a good deal to me is how we are going to get
out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for what do you take me, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For one of the most beautiful enthusiasts I ever
had the pleasure of meeting, madame,&#8221; I replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
with a bow. &#8220;And a leader whom any one should
be glad indeed to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was woman enough to relish the compliment
and she smiled. &#8220;You think I am a leader of these
people, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my regret that I am not one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is not true, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate I shall be delighted to follow your
lead out of this house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not be in any danger, I assure you of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she spoke we heard the sounds of some little
commotion outside the room and I guessed that the
scoundrels had brought up some more of their kind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, but I think we shall soon know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have your word of honour that you will not
breathe a word of anything you have witnessed here
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I pledge my word of honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men outside appeared to have a good deal to
chatter about and seemed none too ready to enter.
They were probably discussing who should have the
privilege of being the first to face my revolver. I
did not like the look of the thing at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they are your friends, why don&#8217;t they come in?&#8221;
I asked my companion. &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better speak
to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed to the door and it occurred to me to
place the head of a chair under the handle and make
it a little more difficult for them to get in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need have no fear, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; she said
with a touch of contempt as I took this precaution.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a slight test of the mood they are in.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she reached the door the injured man began to
show signs of recovering his senses; and I stooped
over him while she spoke to the men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Dr. Barosa there?&#8221; she called.</p>

<p>Getting no reply, she repeated the question and
knocked on the panel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>There was an answer this time, but not at all what
she had expected. One of the fellows fired a pistol
and the bullet pierced the thin panel and went dangerously
near her head.</p>

<p>I pulled her across to a spot where she would be
safe from a chance shot. Only just in time, for half
a dozen shots were fired in quick succession.</p>

<p>She was going to speak again, but I stopped her
with a gesture; and then extinguished one of the two
candles by which the room was lighted.</p>

<p>A long pause followed the shots, as if the scoundrels
were listening to learn the effect of the firing.</p>

<p>In the silence the man in the corner groaned, and
I heard the key turned in the lock as some one tried
to push the door open.</p>

<p>I drew out my weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not shoot them, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
exclaimed my companion under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t this man Barosa know your voice?&#8221; I
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he isn&#8217;t there,&#8221; I said grimly.</p>

<p>I raised my voice and called loudly: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
dare to enter. I&#8217;ll shoot the first man that tries
to.&#8221; Then to my companion: &#8220;You&#8217;d better crouch
down in the corner here. There&#8217;ll be trouble the instant
they are inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had no lack of pluck and shook her head
disdainfully. &#8220;You must not fire. If you shoot
one of these men you will not be safe for an hour in
the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t appear to be particularly safe as it is,&#8221;
I answered drily.</p>

<p>There was another pause; then a vigorous shove
broke the chair I had placed to the door and half
a dozen men rushed in.</p>

<p>As I raised my arm to fire, my companion caught it
and stopped me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>For the space of a few seconds the scoundrels stared
at us, their eyes gleaming in vicious malice and triumph.
I read murder in them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw your weapon on the table there,&#8221; ordered
one of them.</p>

<p>Then a thought occurred to me.</p>

<p>I made as if to obey; but, instead of doing anything
of the sort, I extinguished the remaining candle, grabbed
my companion&#8217;s arm, drew her to the opposite side
of the room and, pushing her into a corner, stood in
front of her.</p>

<p>And in the pitchy darkness we waited for the ruffians
to make the first move in their attack.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>THE RECEPTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE effect of my impulse to extinguish the light
in the room was much greater than I had
anticipated. It proved to be the happiest thought I
had ever had; for I am convinced that it saved my
life, and probably that of my companion.</p>

<p>The average Portuguese of the lower class is too
plugged with superstition ever to feel very happy in
the dark. He is quick to people it with all sorts of
impalpable terrors. And these fellows were soon in
a bad scare.</p>

<p>For a few moments the wildest confusion prevailed.
Execrations, threats, cries of anger, and prayers were
mingled in about equal proportions; and every man
who had a pistol fired it off. At least, that appeared
to be the case, judging by the number of shots.</p>

<p>As they aimed at the corner where they had seen
us, however, nothing resulted except a waste of ammunition.</p>

<p>The darkness was all in my favour. I knew that
any man who touched me in the dark must be an
enemy; while they could not tell, when they ran
against any one, whether it was friend or foe. More
than one struggle among them told me this, and showed
me further what was of at least equal importance&mdash;that
they were afraid to advance farther into the
room.</p>

<p>When a lull came in the racket, therefore, I adopted
another ruse. I crept toward the corner where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
had seen us, and, stamping heavily, cried out that I
would shoot the first man I touched.</p>

<p>Another volley of shots followed; but I was back
out of range again, and soon had very welcome proof
that the trick was successful. Each man appeared
to mistake his neighbour for me, and some of them
were pretty roughly handled by their friends before
the blunders were discovered.</p>

<p>Some one shouted for a light; and in the lull that
succeeded we had a great stroke of luck. The wounded
man, who lay in a corner near to them, began to move
his feet restlessly, and they immediately jumped to
the conclusion that I was going to attack them from
there.</p>

<p>I backed this idea promptly. Letting out a fierce
yell of rage, I fired a shot at random. This filled to
overflowing the cup of their cowardice, and in another
moment they had bolted like rabbits out of the room
and locked the door again.</p>

<p>I lost no time in relighting the candles, and set to
work to pile the furniture against the door to prevent
them taking us again by surprise, and to give me time
to see if we couldn&#8217;t get away by the window.</p>

<p>Opening it as quietly as possible I had a good look
at the bars, and saw that it would be possible to force
them sufficiently apart with wedges for us to squeeze
through.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can reach the street this way, madame?&#8221; I
asked my companion, who was now very badly scared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is useless,&#8221; she replied despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so useless as stopping here. We can&#8217;t expect
such luck a second time as we have just had.&#8221;
I spoke sharply, wishing to rouse her.</p>

<p>But she only shook her head and tossed up her
hands. So I began to break up some of the furniture
to make some wedges, when she jumped to her feet
with a cry of surprise and delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is his voice,&#8221; she exclaimed, her eyes shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
and her face radiant with delight. Whoever &#8220;he&#8221;
might be, it was easy to see what she felt about
him.</p>

<p>Then the key was turned once more and an attempt
made to force away my impromptu barricade.</p>

<p>I closed the window instantly and blew out one of
the candles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door. It is I, Barosa,&#8221; called a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him in, monsieur. Let him in at once. We
are safe now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; I asked, suspecting a trick.</p>

<p>Again the rich colour flooded her face. &#8220;Do you
think I do not know his voice, or that he would harm
me? Let him in. Let him in, I say,&#8221; she cried
excitedly.</p>

<p>I pulled away enough of the barricade to admit one
man at a time. I reckoned that no one man of the
crowd I had seen would have the pluck to come in
alone.</p>

<p>A dark, handsome, well-dressed man squeezed his
way through the opening with an impatient exclamation
on the score of my precaution. And the instant
she saw his face, my companion sprang toward him
uttering his name impetuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Manoel! Manoel! Thank the Holy Virgin you
have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>His appearance excited me also, for I recognized
him at a glance. He had been pointed out to me in
Paris some time before by my brother-in-law as one
of the chief agents of Dom Miguel, the Pretender to
the Portuguese Throne. His real name was Luis
Beriardos. His presence in Lisbon at such a time and
his connexion with a section of the revolutionaries
gave me a clue to the whole business.</p>

<p>The two stood speaking together for a time in whispers,
and then he went out to the others. I heard him
explain that they had made a blunder in regard to
madame and that he was ready to vouch for her as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
one of their best friends and a leader of their
movements.</p>

<p>Some further murmur of talk followed, and when he
returned, one or two of the rest tried to follow. But
I stopped that move. One man was all I meant to
have in the room at a time; and when I told the
others to get out they went. I had managed to make
them understand that it was safer to obey.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean, sir?&#8221; asked Barosa, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need have no fear now, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
added madame.</p>

<p>I replied to Barosa. &#8220;Those men have been telling
you that I am a spy and you have come in to question
me. This lady has assured me that I have nothing
to fear from you. You will therefore have the goodness
to get the key of that door and lock it on this side.
Then we can talk, but not till then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not do anything of the sort,&#8221; he replied
hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall shove these things back in position;&#8221;
and I began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Barosa will get the key, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
put in madame; and she appealed to him with a look.
&#8220;He has saved my life, doctor,&#8221; she said in an undertone.</p>

<p>I noticed that she did not now call him by his
Christian name as in the first flush of her relief.</p>

<p>He hesitated a second or two and then with an
angry shrug of the shoulders complied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the key, doctor,&#8221; I said quietly; and
when he stood irresolute, I pushed past him and
drew it out of the lock. &#8220;Now we can talk, and I&#8217;m
ready to answer any questions, in reason, which you
like to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conduct is very extraordinary, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. These friends of yours take me
for a spy. You may come to the same conclusion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
They tried to take my life; and you may wish to do
the same. I am simply taking precautions. I have
told this lady enough about myself to satisfy her that
I am no spy; but if you are not equally satisfied, I
prefer to remain here with no other company than
ourselves until a chance of getting away offers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was going to reply when madame interposed.
To do her justice she took up my cause with a right
good will. She repeated all I had previously told her,
gave him a graphic account of what had passed,
lauded me to the skies, and ended by declaring her
absolute conviction that every word I had spoken
was the truth.</p>

<p>Feeling that my case was in safe hands, I let them
have it out together. He was suspicious, and at
every proof of this, her anger and indignation increased.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have accepted Mr. Donnington&#8217;s word, Dr.
Barosa,&#8221; she said hotly, when he declared that I ought
not to be allowed to leave the house; &#8220;and I have
given him a pledge for his safety. You know me,
and that I will keep my word. Very well, I declare to
you on my honour that if any harm comes to him
now, I will abandon the cause and reveal everything
I know about it and all concerned in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>That shook all the opposition out of him on the spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are at liberty to go, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he
said at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you; but what about your friends out
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will leave the house with you,&#8221; declared madame.
&#8220;And we will see if any one will dare to try and stop
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be simpler if they were to go first,&#8221; I
suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will answer for them,&#8221; said Barosa. &#8220;We have
your word that you will not speak of anything you
have learned here to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I pledge my word,&#8221; I replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;Let me thank you once more, Mr. Donnington&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
began madame.</p>

<p>But I stopped her. &#8220;We can call the account
between us squared, madame. If I helped you out
of one mess you have got me out of this. And for
the rest, silence for silence. We shall not meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you staying long in the city, sir?&#8221; asked
Barosa with a suggestion of eagerness in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an hour longer than my business here renders
necessary. I am not so delighted with my experiences
so far as to wish to remain.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room then and after a hurried conference
with the fellows outside he called to us and we left
the house.</p>

<p>With what relief I drew the first breath of the fresh
night air will be readily understood; but I do not
think I fully realized how narrow an escape I had had
until I was safe in my rooms and sat recalling the
incidents of the strange adventure.</p>

<p>Who was the woman I had helped? Not a hint
had been dropped of her name; but that she was a
person of as much importance in the world outside as
in the ranks of the revolutionary party of which she
was a leader, I could not doubt. That the conspiracy
was being carried on in the interest of the Pretender
was fairly certain, seeing that this Beriardos, or Barosa,
as he now called himself, was mixed up in it; and I
resolved to write at once to Madrillo to send me everything
he knew about him.</p>

<p>What had he meant, too, by that eager question as
to the length of my stay in the city? He was certainly
not satisfied that I was not a spy. Should I
have to be on the look-out for further trouble from
him and the scum of the city joined with him? It
was a more probable than pleasant prospect.</p>

<p>As that exceedingly handsome creature had reminded
me, I had gained some information which made me
dangerous to these people; and however willing she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
might be to accept my promise of secrecy, it was all
Portugal to a bunch of grapes that the others would
not be so content.</p>

<p>And the irritating part of it was that I had got
into the mess through my own blundering stupidity.
If I hadn&#8217;t been ass enough to go wandering about
the city when I had been warned to stop indoors, I
shouldn&#8217;t have had this bother. But the world is full
of asses; and many of them with a heap more brains
than I. And with a chuckle, as if that silly cynicism
were both an excuse and a consolation, I tossed away
my cigar and went to bed.</p>

<p>A night&#8217;s sound sleep put me on much better terms
with myself, and I scouted the thought of troublesome
personal consequences following my adventure. The
thing was over and done with and I was well out of
the mess.</p>

<p>Instead of bothering to write to Madrillo for details
about this Dr. Barosa, therefore, I went off to the
<i>Stella</i> for a cruise to blow the cobwebs away and think
about Miralda and the meeting with her that evening.</p>

<p>We were to meet at the house of the Marquis de
Pinsara, and my friend, Volheno, had impressed
upon me the importance of the gathering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Affairs are in a somewhat delicate condition just
at present,&#8221; he had said; &#8220;and as there is a great deal
of surface discontent here and in Oporto&mdash;although
the bulk of the country is solid in our favour&mdash;we
have to exercise some care in organizing our followers.
The Marquis de Pinsara is one of M. Franco&#8217;s firmest
adherents, and this reception will really be political
in character. You may have heard of the &#8216;National
League of Portugal?&#8217; No? Well, it is a powerful
loyalist association, and we are doing our utmost to
make the movement fully representative and powerful;&#8221;
and being a politician and proportionately
verbose, he had first inflicted upon me a long account
of the League and its merits, and from that had launched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
into the reasons why he meant to take me to the reception.
Put shortly these were simply that he wished
to interest the Marquis de Pinsara and many of his
loyalist friends in the concessions at Beira which I
had put forward as the object of my visit.</p>

<p>What this process of &#8220;interesting&#8221; the Marquis
meant, I learnt within a few minutes of my entering
his house.</p>

<p>As Volheno sent me a line at the last moment saying
he was detained, I had to go alone and I was very
glad. Not being quite certain how Miralda would
receive me, I did not wish to have any lookers-on
when me met. Moreover, I certainly did not want to
fool away the evening, a good deal of which I hoped
to spend with her, in talking a lot of rot about these
concessions which I had only used as a stalking-horse
for my visit to Lisbon.</p>

<p>But I soon found that in choosing them, I had invested
myself with a most inconvenient amount of importance.</p>

<p>The Marquis received me with as much cordiality
as if I were an old friend and benefactor of
his family. He grasped my hand warmly, expressed
his delight at making my acquaintance, could not
find words to describe his admiration of England
and the English, and then started upon the concessions.</p>

<p>I thought he would never stop, but he came to the
point. Volheno had taken as gospel all the rubbish
I had talked about the prospects of wealth offered
by the concessions, and had passed it on to the marquis
through a magnifying glass until the latter, being a
comparatively poor man, was under the impression
that I could make his fortune. He was more than
willing to be &#8220;interested&#8221; in the scheme; and took
great pains to convince me that without his influence I
could not succeed. And that influence was mine for
a consideration.</p>

<p>In the desire to get free from his button-holing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
gave him promises lavish enough to send him off to
his other guests with eyes positively glittering with
greed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, however, he began to use
his influence at once, and while I was hanging about
near the entrance, waiting to catch Miralda the moment
she arrived, he kept bringing up a number of his friends&mdash;mostly
titled and all tiresome bores&mdash;whom he was
also &#8220;interesting&#8221; in the scheme.</p>

<p>They all said the same thing. Theirs was the only
influence which could secure the concessions for me,
and they all made it plain about the consideration.
I began at length to listen for the phrase and occasionally
to anticipate it; and thus in half an hour or so
I had promised enough backsheesh to have crippled
the scheme ten times over.</p>

<p>One of these old fellows&mdash;a marquis or visconte or
something of the sort, the biggest bore of the lot
anyway&mdash;was in possession of me in a corner when
Miralda arrived, and for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t
shake him off. I was worrying how to get away when
the marquis came sailing up with another of them in
tow, a tall, stiff, hawk-faced, avaricious-looking old
man, with a pompous air, and more orders on his
breast than I could count.</p>

<p>I groaned and wished the concessions at the bottom
of the Tagus, but the next moment had to shut down
a smile. It was the Visconte de Linto, Miralda&#8217;s
stepfather.</p>

<p>The marquis had evidently filled him up with
exaggerated stories of my wealth and the riches I
had come to pour into the pockets of those who assisted
me, and his first tactic was to get rid of the bore
in possession. He did this by carrying me off to
present me to his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>It was the reverse of such a meeting as I had pictured
or desired; for at that moment Miralda was besieged
by a crowd of men clamouring for dances. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
could not think of an excuse, and I had barely time
to explain that I had met Miralda and her mother in
Paris, when the old man pushed his way unceremoniously
through the little throng and introduced me,
stumbling over my name which he had obviously forgotten,
and adding that Miralda must save two or three dances
for me.</p>

<p>As he garbled my name she was just taking her
dance card back from a man who had scribbled his
initials on it and she turned to me with a little impatient
movement of the shoulders which I knew well.</p>

<p>Our eyes met, and my fear that she might have forgotten
me was dissipated on the instant.</p>

<small>MIRALDA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH it was easy to read the look of recognition
in Miralda&#8217;s eyes, it was the reverse of
easy to gather the thoughts which that recognition
prompted. After the first momentary widening of the
lids, the start of surprise, and the involuntary tightening
of the fingers on her fan, she was quick to force a
smile, as she bowed to me, and the smile served as
an impenetrable mask to her real feelings.</p>

<p>The viscontesse gave me a very different welcome.
She was pleased to see me again and frankly expressed
her pleasure. I had done my best to ingratiate myself
in her favour during those three weeks in Paris, and
had evidently been successful. She was a kind-hearted
garrulous soul, and before I could get a word in about
the dances, she plunged into a hundred and one questions
about Paris and England and the beauties of Lisbon, and
why I had not let them know of my coming and so
on, and without giving me time to reply she turned
to Miralda.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely remember Mr. Donnington, child?
We met him in Paris, last spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, mother. His sister is M. Madrillo&#8217;s wife,&#8221;
said Miralda indifferently.</p>

<p>This was not exactly how I wished to be remembered.
&#8220;I am glad you have not forgotten my sister, at any
rate, mademoiselle,&#8221; I replied, intending this to be
very pointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Madrillo showed us many kindnesses, monsieur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and did much to make our stay in Paris pleasant;
and it is not a Portuguese failing to forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was better, for there was a distinct note of
resentment in her voice instead of mere indifference.
But before I could reply, the viscontesse interposed
a very natural but extremely inconvenient question.
&#8220;And what brings you here, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>The visconte answered this, making matters worse
than ever; and there followed a little by-play of
cross purposes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnaheen is here on some very important
business, my dear&mdash;very important business indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I remember, Donnington is the proper pronunciation,
father,&#8221; interposed Miralda, very quietly,
as if courtesy required the correction&mdash;the courtesy
that was due to a stranger, however.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t interrupt me, Miralda,&#8221; he
replied testily. &#8220;This gentleman will understand
how difficult some English names are to pronounce
and will excuse my slip, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, visconte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only sorry I do not speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Donnington is quite easy to pronounce, Affonso,&#8221;
his wife broke in.</p>

<p>He gave a sigh of impatience. &#8220;Of course it is, I
know that well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were speaking of the reason for Mr. Donnington&#8217;s
visit,&#8221; Miralda reminded him demurely; and
as she turned to him her eyes swept impassively
across my face. As if a stranger&#8217;s presence in Lisbon
were a legitimate reason for the polite assumption
of curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in a way Government business; Mr. Donnington&#8221;&mdash;he
got the name right this time and smiled&mdash;&#8220;is
seeking some concessions in our East African
colony and he needs my influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, business in East Africa?&#8221; she repeated, with
a lift of the eyebrows. &#8220;How very interesting;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and with that she turned away and handed her programme
to one of the men pestering her for a dance.</p>

<p>No words she could have spoken and nothing she
could have done would have been so eloquent of her
appreciation of my conduct in absenting myself for
four months and then coming to Lisbon on business.
Once more I wished those infernal concessions at the
bottom of the Tagus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to be of considerable use and you may depend
upon my doing my utmost,&#8221; said the visconte,
self-complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say how highly I shall value your influence,
sir, not only in that but in everything,&#8221; I replied,
putting an emphasis on the &#8220;everything&#8221; in the hope
that Miralda would understand.</p>

<p>But she paid no heed and went on chatting with the
man next her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how long are you staying, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
asked her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a superfluous question that, Maria,&#8221; said
her husband. &#8220;Of course it will depend upon how
your business goes, eh, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw a chance there and took it. &#8220;I am afraid
my object will take longer to accomplish than I hoped,&#8221;
I replied; for Miralda&#8217;s benefit again of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate you will have time for some pleasure-making,
I trust,&#8221; said the viscontesse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Englishmen don&#8217;t let pleasure interfere with business,
my dear, they are far too strenuous,&#8221; replied
her husband, who appeared to think he was flattering
me and doing me a service by insisting that I could
have no possible object beyond business. &#8220;I presume
that you are only here to-night for the one purpose.
The Marquis de Pinsara told me as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment a partner came up to claim Miralda
for a dance, and as she rose she said: &#8220;Mr. Donnington
is fortunate in finding so many to help him in his
business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>&#8220;Wait a moment, Miralda,&#8221; exclaimed her father
as she was turning away. &#8220;Have you kept the dances
for Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again her eyes flashed across mine with the same
half-disdainful smile of indifference. &#8220;Mr. Donnington
has been so occupied discussing the serious purpose
of his visit that he has had no time to think of such
frivolity and ask for them;&#8221; and with that parting
shot she went off to the ball-room without waiting to
hear my protest.</p>

<p>The visconte smiled and gestured. &#8220;I suppose
you don&#8217;t dance, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
heard that many Englishmen do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed he does, Affonso,&#8221; declared his wife quickly.
&#8220;I remember that well in Paris. He and Miralda
often danced together. And now, sit down here in
Miralda&#8217;s place till she comes back and let us have a
chat about Paris,&#8221; she added to me.</p>

<p>But the old visconte had not quite done with me.
Drawing me aside&mdash;&#8220;I want you to feel that I shall
do all in my power, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>I knew what was coming so I anticipated him. &#8220;I
am sure of that, and I have been given to understand
that you can do more for me than any one else in Portugal.
And of course you&#8217;ll understand that those who assist
me in the early stages will naturally share in the after
advantages and gains. I make a strong point of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course that was not in my mind at all,&#8221; he
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. But I should insist upon it,&#8221; I said
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it will be a very big thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Millions in it, visconte. Millions;&#8221; and I threw
out my hands as if half the riches of the earth would
soon be in their grasp. &#8220;And of course I know that
without you I should be powerless.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appreciated this thoroughly and went off on
excellent terms with himself and with a high opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of me as a potential source of wealth, while I sat down
by the viscontesse to explain why four months had
passed since we met.</p>

<p>But these miserable concessions gave me no peace.
I was only beginning my explanation when up came
the marquis and dragged me off for the first of another
batch of introductions, followed by a long conference
in another room with him and Volheno who had
meanwhile arrived. And just as the marquis took
my arm to lead me away, and thus prevented my
escape, Miralda returned from the dance.</p>

<p>A single glance showed her that I was fully occupied
in the business which I had been forced to admit in
her presence was the object of my visit to Lisbon,
and the expression of her eyes and the shrug of her
shoulders were a sufficient indication of her feeling.</p>

<p>I was properly punished for the silly lie which I had
merely intended to conceal my real purpose, and
when I saw Miralda welcome a fresh partner with a
smile which I would have given the whole of Portuguese
Africa to have won from her, I could scarcely
keep my temper.</p>

<p>I was kept at this fool talk for an hour or more when
I ought to have been making my peace with her, and
I resolved on the spot to invent a telegram from
London the next day reporting a hitch in the negotiations.</p>

<p>When at length I got free, Miralda was not anywhere
to be seen; and I wandered about the rooms
and in and out of the conservatories looking for her,
putting up no end of couples in odd corners and getting
deservedly scowled at for my pains.</p>

<p>I saw her at last among the dancers; and I stood and
watched her, gritting my teeth in the resolve that no
titled old bores nor even wild horses should prevent
my speaking to her as soon as the waltz was over.</p>

<p>I stalked her into a palm house which I had missed
in my former search and, giving her and her partner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
just enough time to find seats, I followed and walked
straight up to them.</p>

<p>She knew I was coming. I could tell that by the
way she squared her shoulders and affected the deepest
interest in her partner&#8217;s conventional nothings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the next is our dance, mademoiselle,&#8221; I
said unblushingly, as I affected to consult my card.
She gave a start as if entirely surprised by and
rather indignant at the interruption; while her partner
had the decency to rise. But she glanced at her
card and then looked up with a bland smile and shook
her head. &#8220;I am afraid you are mistaken, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was going to resume his place by her side,
but I stopped that. &#8220;I have the honour of your
initials here, and if to my intense misfortune you have
given the dance to two of us, perhaps this gentleman
will allow me, as an old acquaintance of yours, to enjoy
the few minutes of interval to deliver an important
message entrusted to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was under the fire of her eyes all the time I was
delivering this flowery and untruthful rigmarole;
but I was as voluble and as grave as a judge. I took
the man in all right. I made him feel that under the
circumstances he was in the way and with a courteous
bow to us both, he excused himself.</p>

<p>Miralda was going to request him to remain, I think,
so I took possession of the vacant chair; and then of
course she could not bring him back without making
too much of the incident and possibly causing a little
scene.</p>

<p>That I had offended her I could not fail to see; her
hostility and resentment were obvious, but whether the
cause was my present effrontery or my long neglect
of her, I had yet to find out.</p>

<p>She did not quite know what to do. After sitting
a few moments in rather frowning indecision, she half
rose as if she were going to leave me, but with a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
toss of the head she decided against that and turned
to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a message for me, monsieur?&#8221; Her
tone was one of studied indifference and her look
distinctly chilling.</p>

<p>&#8220;For one thing, my sister desired to be most kindly
remembered to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Up went the deep fringed lids and the dark eyebrows,
as a comment upon the message which I had described
as important. &#8220;Please to tell Madame Madrillo that
I am obliged by her good wishes and reciprocate
them.&#8221; This ridiculously stilted phrase made it
difficult for me to resist a smile. But I played up to
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel myself deeply honoured, mademoiselle, by
being made the bearer of any communication from
you. I will employ my most earnest efforts to convey
to my sister your wishes and the auspicious circumstances
under which they are so graciously expressed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had to turn away before I finished, but she
would not smile. There was, however, less real chill
and more effort at formality when she replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you have delivered your message, monsieur&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she finished with a wave of the hands, as if dismissing
me.</p>

<p>But I was not going of course, and then I made a
very gratifying little discovery. Her dance card was
turned over by her gesture and I saw that for the next
dance she had no partner.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is only one of the messages, mademoiselle,&#8221;
I replied after a pause in the same stilted tone. &#8220;Have
I your permission to report the second?&#8221;</p>

<p>I guessed she was beginning to see the absurdity of
it, for she turned slightly away from me and bowed,
not trusting herself to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother-in-law, M. Stefan Madrillo, desired
me to bring you an assurance of his best wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any messages from the children also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
monsieur?&#8221; she asked quickly, with a swift flash of
her glorious eyes.</p>

<p>I kept it up for another round. &#8220;I am honoured
by being able to assure you that their boy appreciated
to the full the bon-bons which were the outcome of
your distinguished generosity when in Paris, and retains
his appetite for delicacies; but the little girl,
not yet being able to speak, has entrusted me with
no more than some gurgles and coos. To my profound
regret I cannot reproduce them verbatim. May I
have the honour of conveying your reply?&#8221;</p>

<p>She kept her face turned right away from me and
did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have yet another message, mademoiselle, if your
patience is not exhausted,&#8221; I said after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still another, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still another, mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From whom, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From a man you knew in Paris, mademoiselle,
Mr. Ralph Donnington. He has charged me to
explain&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to hear that one, thank you,&#8221; she
broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is absolutely determined that you shall
hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall?&#8221; she cried warmly, throwing back her
head with a lovely poise of indignation and looking
straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, shall,&#8221; I replied firmly. &#8220;I have travelled
over a thousand miles to deliver it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not interested in mining concessions, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
she cried scornfully, thinking to wither me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her intense surprise at this put all her indignation
to flight, and left nothing in her eyes but bewildered
curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor am I,&#8221; I repeated with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I said when she paused. &#8220;I had to
have a pretext.&#8221;</p>

<p>She knew what I meant then and lowered her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I still do not wish to hear Mr. Donnington&#8217;s message,&#8221;
she said after a pause and in a very different
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to force it upon you now, and certainly
not against your wish. I may be some months
in Lisbon, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is the band for the next dance, I must go,&#8221;
she interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen by your card that you have no partner;
but if you wish me to leave you I will do so, or
take you back to the viscontesse&mdash;unless you will
give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She leant back in her chair, her head bent, her brows
gathered in a frown of perplexity and her fingers
playing nervously with her fan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to dance, Mr. Donnington, thank
you,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence followed. She was agitated and I
perplexed.</p>

<p>After perhaps a minute of this silence, I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to be alone, mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not reply and I was turning to leave when
she looked up quickly. &#8220;I do not wish you to go,
Mr. Donnington.&#8221; Then putting aside the thoughts,
whatever they were, which had been troubling her,
she laughed and added: &#8220;Why should I? It is
pleasant to meet an old acquaintance. You have
come through Paris on your way here, of course. Were
you there long?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was more perplexed by the change of tone and
manner than by her former silent preoccupation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come through Paris,&#8221; I replied, as I
resumed my seat. &#8220;I came from England in the
<i>Stella</i>&mdash;my yacht.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>&#8220;You have had delightful weather for your cruise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not cruising in that sense. The <i>Stella</i> is a
very fast boat and I came in her because I could get
here more quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our Portuguese railways are very slow, of course,
and the Spanish trains no better. It is a very tedious
journey from Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; I agreed. Whether she wished to make
small talk in order to avoid my explanation, I did not
know; but I fell in with her wish and then tried to
lead round to the old time in Paris.</p>

<p>She turned my references to it very skilfully however,
and after my third unsuccessful attempt, she
herself referred to it in a way that forced me to regard
it as a sealed page.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been very pleasant to meet you again, Mr.
Donnington, and have such a delightful chat, and I
am so much obliged to you for not having pressed
me to dance. I hope we shall see a good deal of you
while you are here. You quite captured my dear
mother during that time in Paris. Of course you&#8217;ll
call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ventured to leave cards immediately on my
arrival.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she rose. &#8220;I must really go now. Major
Sampayo will be looking for me for the next dance.
Have you met the major yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so; but I have had so many introductions
this evening that I don&#8217;t remember all the
names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, the result of your supposed purpose in Lisbon,
probably. Of course I shall keep your secret,&#8221; she
replied with a smile. Then a sudden change came
over her. She paused, the hand which held her fan
trembled, the effort to maintain the light indifference
of voice and manner became apparent, and her voice
was a trifle unsteady as she added: &#8220;You will meet
Major Sampayo at our house. Ah, here he comes with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
my friend the Contesse Inglesia. I suppose my mother
has told you I am betrothed to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news gripped me like a cramp in the heart, and
I caught my breath and gritted my teeth as I stared at
her.</p>

<p>But the next instant I rallied. The pain and concern
in her eyes seemed to explain what had so perplexed
me in her manner. Her agitation when I told
her the real purpose of my presence; her quick assumption
of indifference, of mere acquaintanceship, her
studious evasion of my references to our time in Paris,
and her light surface talk on things of no concern to
either of us. If my new wild hope was right, all this
had been merely intended to school herself to refer
lightly to the matter of her betrothal.</p>

<p>I forced a smile. &#8220;Permit me to congratulate&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
I began; but the words died on my lips as I turned
and saw the two people whom she had mentioned.</p>

<p>The man, Major Sampayo, I knew to be one of the
vilest scoundrels who ever escaped the gallows.</p>

<p>And his companion was the woman whose life I had
saved from her revolutionary associates on the previous
night.</p>

<small>INEZ</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WITH a big effort I managed to pull myself
together, and much to Miralda&#8217;s surprise I
covered my momentary confusion with a hearty laugh
and a sentence spoken for the benefit of the other two
who were now within earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve bored you frightfully, but I
couldn&#8217;t resist sparing a few minutes from this concession-mongering
business. And after your saying that
the viscontesse remembers our chats in Paris, I shall
certainly ask her to allow me to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>I succeeded in speaking in the tone of a quite casual
acquaintance, and I turned to find two pairs of eyes
fixed intently upon me.</p>

<p>Whether the fellow who now called himself Major
Sampayo recognized me I could not tell, but his companion
did, and I waited for her to decide whether
we were to acknowledge that we had met.</p>

<p>She made no sign and I made my bow to Miralda
and was moving off when the major intervened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you present me to your friend, Miralda?&#8221;</p>

<p>I could have kicked him for the glib use of her name.
I paused and turned with a smile, as if highly pleased
by the request. If I knew myself, the kicking would
come later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington, may I introduce Major Sampayo?&#8221;
said Miralda, a little nervously.</p>

<p>I bowed and smirked, but behind the entrenchment
of English reserve I made no offer to take his hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>&#8220;I am glad to meet you, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider myself equally fortunate, Major Sampayo.&#8221;</p>

<p>I saw then that he had an uneasy feeling that we
had met somewhere before, and his eyes moved from
side to side as he searched his memory to place my
voice or face or name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that really Mr. Donnington?&#8221; exclaimed his
companion, with a delightful assumption of interested
surprise. &#8220;My dear Miralda, please don&#8217;t leave me
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend the Contesse Inez Inglesia,&#8221; said Miralda.</p>

<p>She held out her hand and as I took it she looked
straight into my eyes with a most cordial smile. &#8220;I
have heard so much about you, Mr. Donnington, that
I have been questioning every one I know to find a
mutual friend, and wandering all over the rooms to
find you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Which meant that she knew I had been a long time
with Miralda.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have such an implicit faith in Portuguese sincerity,
contesse, that you will turn my head if you
flatter me so. The fact is I have been making an
unconscionable bore of myself with Mademoiselle Dominguez.
I met her and the viscontesse in Paris last spring,
and I was so glad to find a face I knew to-night, that
I could not resist the temptation for a chat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been long in Lisbon, sir?&#8221; asked Sampayo,
still worrying himself about me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two days, major, that&#8217;s all. I came in my
yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you&#8217;ve heard about Mr. Donnington,
major,&#8221; said the contesse. &#8220;He&#8217;s the millionaire
who has come about the mining concessions in Beira,
or somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I had not heard that,&#8221; he replied, with a little
start, as if this might have suggested a clue to his
problem. &#8220;Have you been in Beira, sir?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;I suppose
I ought not to own it, but I was never there in my
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Sampayo knows every inch of South Africa,
Mr. Donnington,&#8221; said the contesse. &#8220;He was out
there at the time your country was at war with the
Boers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed,&#8221; said I, as if in great surprise. I knew
that well enough. &#8220;Then I shall hope to get some
wrinkles from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You served in that war, didn&#8217;t you, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
asked Miralda, evidently feeling she ought
to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a few months. I was in Bloemfontein and
Mafeking.&#8221; I purposely named places as distant as
possible from the spot where I had seen him. I did
not wish him to recognize me yet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you out at the finish of the campaign?&#8221; he
asked at the prompting of his uneasy fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;About the middle. I was sent down country after
the relief of Mafeking.&#8221; This was half truth but also
half lie. I had gone up again almost immediately.
But it appeared to ease his unrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a curious feeling that we have met somewhere,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;and was wondering whether it could
have been out in South Africa. That was the reason
for my rather inquisitive questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Oh, I should have recognized you in
a moment if that had been the case. I never forget a
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>This made him uneasy again, but, as the band struck
up, he gave his arm to Miralda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for a delightful chat, mademoiselle,&#8221; I
said lightly to Miralda. &#8220;May I take you to your
partner, madame?&#8221; I asked, offering my arm to the
Contesse.</p>

<p>Instead of accepting it she said to Miralda. &#8220;If
you see Vasco tell him I&#8217;ll give him another waltz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
for this. I am going to sit this out with Mr. Donnington&mdash;that
is, of course, if he is willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him, Inez,&#8221; replied Miralda over her shoulder
as she walked away.</p>

<p>Inez was silent until they were out of hearing, and
then she said very meaningly: &#8220;What an excellent
actor you are, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I return the compliment? I saw that you
wished it to appear that we were complete strangers.
And with your permission that is just what we have
been up to the moment of this introduction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause followed by a surprise for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are Miralda&#8217;s Englishman!&#8221;</p>

<p>But I was too well on my guard to betray myself.
&#8220;Am I really?&#8221; I asked with an easy laugh. &#8220;We
had a jolly time for a week or two, but&mdash;that&#8217;s four
months ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fond of camelias, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am wearing one, as you see,&#8221; I replied pointing
to my buttonhole. But I had often given camelias
to Miralda in those three weeks; and this handsome,
dangerous, stately creature with hazel eyes, which
were open and frank or diabolically sly at will, knew
it.</p>

<p>Again she paused once more as the preface to a shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about Major Sampayo, Mr.
Donnington?&#8221; She flashed the question at me, her
eyes searchlights in their intensity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s quite a handsome man and looks awfully
well in that rather gorgeous uniform; and I
presume those orders on his chest show that he is as
distinguished a soldier as he looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken without even a shadow of hesitation. I
declare that every moment I admire your acting
more.&#8221; She let her eyes rest on mine and half closed
the lids. &#8220;I think I am glad I am not Major Sampayo,&#8221;
she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should imagine you have every reason to be satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
with your own delightfully handsome personality.
But if it comes to that, I am also glad I am not the
major.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even with Miralda thrown in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even with Miralda thrown in,&#8221; I repeated with
a laugh. &#8220;She&#8217;s a very charming girl and exceedingly
pretty and all that. She was acknowledged to
be one of the prettiest girls in Paris last spring, you
know, and I admire her tremendously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A frank admission of unconcerned admiration is
very clever, of course, but I am not deceived by it, Mr.
Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Well then shall I confess that I worship her,
that the ground her foot touches is changed to holy
soil; that when she smiles I am in heaven, and when
she frowns, in hell; and that for four months I have
only existed on the hope of seeing her again; that she
fills my heart, inspires my every thought, dominates
my every action, permeates my being, and is the end-all
and be-all of my life?&#8221; I declaimed all this with a
lot of extravagant gesture; and then added in a different
tone: &#8220;And why on earth do you want to insist
that I am in love with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary that I know exactly the relationship
between you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My relationship is precisely the same as between
you and myself, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we not all cousins in more or less remote
degree&mdash;in our descent from Adam and Eve?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rustled her shoulders impatiently. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you understand what I mean? You know how we
first met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh ho, and is the fair Miralda one of you?&#8221; I
laughed. &#8220;But I thought that subject was
taboo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know my secret and I can therefore talk
freely to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;I would very much rather that you did not, if you
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am under the deepest of all obligations to you,
Mr. Donnington; you saved my life and I wish to be
your friend. If you have any such feeling for Miralda
as you have burlesqued, I owe it to you to let you
understand things and be warned in time. It is not possible
for a foreigner to know the undercurrents of life here
at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady, I am only trying to swim on the surface.
I find myself to-night in the house of one of the
staunchest supporters of the Government at a gathering
intended to strengthen the position of the loyalist
body&mdash;the National League of Portugal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am one of the acknowledged leaders of that
League.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not restrain a start of astonishment at this;
and she noticed it, of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised. But many of those here are
my friends&mdash;my political friends, I mean. It was my
public connexion with the League which led me into
the trouble last night. The men who threatened me
knew of my position in it, but not of my sympathies
with them&mdash;that of course is as close a secret as
possible&mdash;and by a trick decoyed me to a house where I
was seized and brought to where you found me. The
intention was to kill me and then carry me into the
streets to make it appear that I had been killed in the
rioting. You will understand from this the dangerous
forces that are at work. Some of those men
suspect you of being a spy and you will be well advised
not to prolong your stay in Lisbon. And your friendship
with M. Volheno will not add to your safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cannot an Englishman come here without being
taken for a spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that one of your best English detectives
has been employed by the Spanish Government
to reorganize the detective force there. One story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
I have heard is that you yourself are an English detective
engaged by M. Volheno to help in unearthing some
of the conspiracies here, and that your desire to obtain
some concessions in Africa is a mere blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be difficult to go much further away
about me, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet those who seek concessions from a Government
do not usually advertise the fact far and wide.
You are a man of courage and resource: we have had
proof of that. You have learnt some of our secrets
and one of our haunts. You have some secret knowledge
about Major Sampayo that threatens him; and
you are more than clever enough to sustain the part
of an Englishman of wealth and position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you mean that you yourself believe this
preposterous story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I should like to know the real reason
for your coming here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that Dr. Barosa, does he take me for a spy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we have already made inquiries about you from
our friends in England. But, like myself, he wishes
to know why you are here. You will do well to give
me your confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your other colleague&mdash;Major Sampayo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not tell you that he was with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in so many words. And really I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will remember where he has met you before,
and the facts may help us to know more about you&mdash;for
your benefit or otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear madame, if you mean that for a threat,
it does not in the least alarm me. Let me tell you once
for all I am not a member of the English detective
force; my presence here has not the remotest connexion
with your politics or your plots; and I have
no sort of sympathy with them one way or another.
I am just an average Englishman; and as such claim
the right to go where I will when I will, so long as I
mind my own business. And as an Englishman I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
can take care of myself and must decline to be frightened
out of doing what I wish to do either by charming,
cultured and handsome ladies, like yourself, or by
such gutter scum as I had the tussle with last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you refuse to give me your confidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me put it rather that I have really no confidence
worth giving. I shall hold absolutely secret
what you have told me&mdash;that on my honour. And
now do you mind if we talk about the scenery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have cause to regret it, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear madam, I have arrived at the mature
age of twenty-seven, and probably twenty-six of
them are full of regrets for lost chances. But there is
a question of real seriousness I should like to put to
you,&#8221; I said very gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the name of the third, no the fourth bluff,
to the north of the river mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned and bent those strange eyes of hers upon
me with an intent stare. &#8220;You mean me to understand
that you regard everything I have said&mdash;my
warning, my questions, everything&mdash;as a mere jest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that, although I am by the way of being a
wilful person, I am not an ungrateful one; and that
if you would do me the honour one day of making up
a little party to view that bluff from the deck of my
yacht, it would give me great pleasure and I hope
promote that better understanding between us which
I should like to think you desire as much as I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept willingly,&#8221; she replied with a smile;
but even then she could not resist a thrust. Looking
at me out of the half-veiled corners of her eyes she
asked: &#8220;May I bring Major Sampayo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means, and Dr. Barosa and any others of
your colleagues&mdash;even the fair Miralda; and I will
have cosy corners specially fitted up for you all where
you may talk politics or personalities as you prefer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again her strange eyes fastened on mine, searchingly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
&#8220;What do you really mean by that?&#8221; she asked,
with tense earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t let us get serious again, and read
grave meanings into mere trifling banalities,&#8221; I
exclaimed with a laugh. &#8220;I mean no more than that
I should try to give you all a good time and let you
enjoy it in your own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I am to enjoy it, Mr. Donnington, you must
ask Miralda&#8217;s brother, Lieutenant de Linto.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady, I&#8217;ll ask the whole regiment if you
wish it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes, you can ask him now. I suppose
you know him?&#8221;</p>

<p>A young fellow in the uniform of a lieutenant had
entered the palm house and came hurrying toward
us. I did not care for his looks. Tall and slight of
figure, a foppish and affected manner, an&aelig;mic and
dissipated in looks with a narrow, retreating forehead,
no chin to speak of, and prominent eyes, in one of
which he had an eyeglass, I set him down as weak,
unstable, shallow, and generally undesirable. But he
was Miralda&#8217;s half-brother and thus to me a person
of consideration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Inez, this is too bad. I&#8217;ve been hunting
for you everywhere and the dance is all but over.&#8221;</p>

<p>She beamed on him with one of her richest smiles.
&#8220;I own my fault, Vasco, but I sent word to you by
Miralda. I simply could not resist the opportunity
of a chat with the distinguished Englishman every one
is talking about. Mr. Donnington, Lieutenant de
Linto.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had risen and shook hands cordially, expressing
my pleasure at meeting him. &#8220;I fear that unwittingly
I have taken your place, lieutenant,&#8221; I added.
&#8220;Pray pardon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my card, Vasco. Take two dances for the
one we have missed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right then,&#8221; he said, as he took her card<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
eagerly and scribbled his initials on it. &#8220;I think after
all I&#8217;m obliged to you, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he added
with a vacuous smile which he intended to be pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington has asked me to make up a little
yachting party one day, Vasco, and I was just mentioning
your name as you came up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, but I&#8217;m a rare bad sailor,&#8221; he replied
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll choose a fine day then, Vasco. And of
course I couldn&#8217;t go without you.&#8221; She laid her hand
on his arm and glanced up into his face with a yearning
look which convinced him of her perfect sincerity and
fetched a sigh out of him that told its own tale.</p>

<p>I excused myself promptly, and as I turned away he
took the chair by her side, feasting his big eyes
on her beauty and letting his little senses surfeit
themselves in the glamour of her charms.</p>

<p>She had his scalp right enough. He was hers, body and
soul and honour. But why had she taken the trouble?
She cared for him even less than I cared for her;
and the night before I had seen her look at Barosa
with the light which only one man can bring to a
woman&#8217;s eyes. Only one at a time, anyway.</p>

<p>Why then should she fool this little insignificant
creature? Of course she had a purpose. She was
not the woman to waste her time and her glances for
nothing.</p>

<p>Was it those confounded politics again? One
of the little wheels within the big one which was to
have its part to play when the whole machinery of
plot and conspiracy was set in motion.</p>

<p>Fools can be useful at times.</p>

<p>What part had this one to play?</p>

<p>It was nothing to me&mdash;and yet it might be much.
He was Miralda&#8217;s brother; and nothing which concerned
her could be indifferent to me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>DR. BAROSA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS I made my way through the crowded rooms with
the object of finding the viscontesse and making
sure of an invitation to her house, I saw Miralda and
Sampayo sitting together. They did not see me and
I stood a moment watching them.</p>

<p>He appeared to be urging her to do something and
his eyes were insistent, compelling and passionate.
There was no doubt that he felt for her all the animal
love of which such a man is capable.</p>

<p>But there was no answering light in her eyes. She
was passive, cold and indifferent; and the emotion he
stirred was more like fear than anything.</p>

<p>Instinctively I hated the man and felt an unholy
glow of gladness at the thought that at a word from
me any hold or influence he could have over her would
snap like a rotten twig.</p>

<p>My thoughts slipped back to that old time in South
Africa; and in place of the swaggering major of cavalry,
with his breast covered with orders, I saw him as I
had seen him there, a broken-down tatter-de-mallion
member of the hungry brigade at Koomarte Port;
general sponge, reputed spy and acknowledged rascal,
passing as a Frenchman under the name of Jean
Dufoire; one of the many scamps who infested the
border between the Transvaal and the Portuguese
Colony, ripe for any scoundrelism from theft to throat-slitting.</p>

<p>This was the story I knew about him. When old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Kruger was bundling off his private fortune to Europe,
this Dufoire managed to get hold of some secret information
about one of the consignments and joined with
three other men to steal it. They were successful.
The two men in charge of it were found murdered;
and the money, said to be nearly &pound;50,000, was missing.</p>

<p>But that was not all. Not content with a share of
the loot, Dufoire first picked a quarrel with one of
his companions and shot him treacherously, and then
cheated the other two of the greater part of the money
and disappeared.</p>

<p>The facts came out when the two men were afterwards
captured. One of them died; and just before
his death confessed everything, in the hope that the
British would take the matter up and secure Dufoire&#8217;s
punishment. Many men were aware that I knew
Dufoire by sight; and when the war was over and I
was leaving Capetown for home, the other scamp,
a Corsican named Lucien Prelot, sought me out to get
news of him. He swore by all the saints in the calendar
that if he could ever find Dufoire he would drive a
knife between his ribs. He begged me on his knees
to let him know if I ever met Dufoire again; and vowed,
Corsican as he was, that he would go from one end of
the world to the other in his quest for revenge.</p>

<p>Of course I would not have anything to do with such
an affair; but he managed in some way to ferret out
my address in England and wrote me two or three
letters urging the same request. And then one day
he turned up in London to tell me that he had made
money on the Rand, that he was in Europe searching
for Dufoire, and that he could and would pay me any
sum I chose to ask if I would tell him where to find his
enemy.</p>

<p>That was about a year before my father&#8217;s death;
and every month had brought me a letter from him,
in the hope that I could send news. These letters
were addressed from various parts of Europe where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
he was pursuing his search, with the deadly intensity
of his unslaked and unslakable thirst for revenge.</p>

<p>And while Prelot was hunting for a Frenchman
of the name of Jean Dufoire, the scoundrel himself
had been strutting it in the Portuguese capital as
Francisco Sampayo, major of cavalry. He had
purchased his position, of course, with the fortune he
had acquired by robbery, bloodshed and treachery;
and had found some means to use it to obtain the
promise of Miralda&#8217;s hand in marriage.</p>

<p>That some underhand means had been employed to
force her consent I was certain; as certain as that I
could scare the brute out of the country with half a
dozen words. But before I spoke them I felt that I
must learn more of the facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; The voice
broke in upon my reverie, and I turned to find Dr.
Barosa at my elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, good evening, Dr. Barosa,&#8221; I replied, as we
shook hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were looking very thoughtful, sir; I am afraid
I disturbed you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have reason to be thoughtful, doctor. I am more
than a little perplexed by the position in which I find
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be delighted to be of any service, if I can.
Would you care for a chat here, or may I do myself
the pleasure of calling upon you at your rooms?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both, by all means. I should like a word or two
with you, and the sooner the better; but I shall also
be glad to see you at my rooms at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thanked me and led the way to a spot where we
could talk privately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go straight to the point, doctor: that is our
English way. I have had a conversation with Contesse
Inglesia this evening, and I wish to disabuse your
mind thoroughly of any thought that I am a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir, I do not think it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish you only to think it, I want you to
know. You&#8217;ll appreciate the difference. I am ready
to give you any proofs you can suggest, to answer
any questions you like to put, and to back every word
I say with facts. I am tremendously in earnest about
this. And when you have thoroughly convinced
yourself, I wish you to convince any one and every
one associated with you, who may be inclined to suspect
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your reasons, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must surely be obvious. Last night&#8217;s business
showed me the length to which some of your more
reckless friends are prepared to carry mistakes of the
kind; and I desire to be able to walk the streets of
the city without expecting to be shot or knifed at the
next corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not doubt you, and certainly do not presume
to ask for any facts; but if you would prefer to make
any statement, I am of course ready to listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>I replied to that by giving him a fairly full account
of myself, and then added: &#8220;Of course I am aware
that my statement, unsupported by evidence, could
easily be made up by any one who was here as a spy.
I suggest, therefore, that you shall get evidence of my
identity. The best and simplest thing I can suggest at
the moment is that I give you the addresses of various
firms who have photographed me from time to time,
and that you send your agents to them to get photographs
of Ralph Donnington which they have taken.
You can then send some one to my place at Tapworth
for the photographs to be identified; you can have
them shown also to my bankers in London; and to
any one of a dozen people who know all about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I accept your word, I assure you,&#8221; he said, with a
wave of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is just what I do not wish you to do.
You must be in a position to say you know, and to
table the evidence;&#8221; and with that I wrote down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
names and addresses and insisted upon his taking
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the matter is naturally pressing you will of
course use the telegraph, and if money will expedite
your inquiries I will very gladly pay any sum that is
necessary. I am, fortunately for myself, a man of
considerable means, and not likely to spare money to
put an end to this intolerable suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have invited me to question you. There is
one point. You are a friend of M. Volheno?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That gentleman, as I have told you, was brought
to our place, Tapworth Hall, by my sister&#8217;s husband,
M. Stefan Madrillo, some years ago, and when I came
over here about these concessions, Madrillo advised
me to see him. Only in that degree is he a friend of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These concessions have been spoken about, Mr.
Donnington, with unusual freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not my doing. M. Volheno gave a somewhat
lurid account of them to the Marquis de Pinsara,
as a man likely to be able to help in the matter; and
the latter appears to have told all his acquaintances.
I shall not be in the least surprised to find the matter in
the papers in the morning. Of course it is very
ridiculous and calculated to frustrate my object entirely.
But it is not my doing, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet M. Volheno might have an object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to use them to conceal some other
purpose for my visit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you give me your word that you have no
other purpose except to obtain these concessions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Contesse Inglesia put much the same question, and
I will answer it as I answered her. I pledge my word
that I have no sort or kind of interest in the political
affairs of your country otherwise than as they may be
incidentally connected with these concessions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that an entirely frank answer, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any suspicion underlying that remark I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
already given you the means of dissipating. I declare
to you, on my honour as an English gentleman, that I
have none but absolutely private and personal reasons
for coming to Lisbon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have discussed political matters with M.
Volheno?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not in any detail. He told me the city
was in a condition of unrest, and that there were all
sorts of more or less dangerous combinations against
the Government. But this was merely as a reason
for the warning he gave me against being in the streets
alone after dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not heed that warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I was disposed to smile at it. But I learnt
my lesson last night, and shall profit by it in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barosa sat a few moments thinking. &#8220;I will
have these inquiries made, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he said
then; &#8220;but I have no doubt whatever of the result.
I will make it my personal affair to see that you have
no trouble. In point of fact we already have proof
that you are what you say. Mademoiselle Dominguez
and her mother met you in Paris last spring, and they
of course know you to be Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did he want to drag Miralda into the matter?</p>

<p>&#8220;I have intentionally kept her name out of our conversation,
Dr. Barosa,&#8221; I answered with a smile, &#8220;and
I still wish you to make your own investigations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Contesse Inglesia is disposed to think that
your meeting with Mademoiselle Dominguez is connected
with your presence here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The contesse is a very charming and delightful
woman, doctor, and being a woman is likely to jump
to conclusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will understand, of course, that any such
purpose would concern us. She is a friend of our
cause, and betrothed to a man to whom we are under
great obligations, Major Sampayo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask you, if you please, not to give me any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
information about either your friends or your objects.
For the rest, I shall be glad to know when you have
satisfied yourself about me; and afterwards, if you
wish, to see you at any time as a friend. But no politics,
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took this as a hint that the subject should be
dropped, and he switched off to a topic I was always
ready to talk about, yachting and yachts in general,
and my own boat in particular. He was a keen
yachtsman, and when I suggested that he should find
time to have a run on the <i>Stella</i>, he accepted the
invitation quite eagerly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I rather liked him. He had
treated me quite candidly; and I was convinced he
was satisfied that, whatever might be my real object
in coming to the city, it had no connexion with the
political situation. His politics were no concern of
mine. I was absolutely indifferent whether the King
of Portugal was Dom Carlos or Dom Miguel; and it
was no part of my duty to tell Volheno or any one else
that this keen-eyed smooth-voiced, doctor, who was
accepted as a loyalist in this most loyalist of gatherings,
was in reality a secret agent of the Pretender endeavouring
to exploit this National League in the interests of
his master.</p>

<p>The only point where the thing threatened to affect
me was in regard to Sampayo. Barosa had admitted
that they were under great obligations to him, and I
read this to mean that some of old Oom Paul&#8217;s money
was finding its way into the coffers of the cause.</p>

<p>If, in return for the money, Sampayo had stipulated
for the support of Barosa and the rest in regard to
Miralda, there might be trouble. But I was so confident
of being able to bring that scoundrel to his
knees that I could view even such an alliance without
concern.</p>

<p>What I had to do first was to get at Miralda&#8217;s own
feelings and the reasons behind her engagement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and for that I must do my best to secure her mother
as an ally.</p>

<p>The viscontesse greeted me with a smile and a shake
of the head. &#8220;You&#8217;ve neglected me shamefully, Mr.
Donnington. Here&#8217;s nearly the whole evening gone
and we&#8217;ve scarcely had a word together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we shall have many opportunities. I assure
you I have not had a minute to myself the whole
evening, and after all a place like this is not the best
in the world for a real friendly talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When can you spare time to come and see us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May you come, indeed? Why of course you
not only may, but must. Now when?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you be at home to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always at home. Come in the afternoon.
I&#8217;ve such a lot to tell you. I suppose you&#8217;ve heard
about Miralda and Major Sampayo. I was just going
to tell you about it this evening when that wretched
old marquis carried you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean your daughter&#8217;s engagement? Yes.
She herself told me of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think him a handsome man? They call
him one of the handsomest men in the army. And
he&#8217;s very rich, too. There were heaps of women setting
their caps at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man who is both rich and handsome is generally
labelled desirable. At least in London and presumably
in Lisbon also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find that out before you have been here
long. Do you think our girls pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of them are much more than pretty,&#8221; I
agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like an introduction to any of them?
I&#8217;ll do it for you in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too pleased to be where I am to wish anything
of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you always knew how to say nice things,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
Mr. Donnington. I often think of that time in Paris,
and sometimes I&mdash;do you know what I used to think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was the subject of your thoughts I trust they
were pleasant ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know an old woman&mdash;I call myself old, but
I&#8217;m offended in an instant if any one else does&mdash;an
old woman, especially the mother of a pretty girl&mdash;you
think Miralda pretty, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By far the prettiest in the rooms to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a mother gets into the way of thinking that
when a young man pays her attention, it&#8217;s vicarious,
you know. A woman&#8217;s never too old to relish attentions,
of course, but I suppose you know that. But
in Paris I had my suspicions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of whom, viscontesse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of you, Mr. Donnington. Perhaps I should say
they were rather hopes than suspicions. You were
a great favourite of mine, I&#8217;ll admit that. At the
same time, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure that some of the nice
things you said and did were solely on my account.
But that&#8217;s all over now, of course&mdash;over and done
with;&#8221; and she smiled and fanned herself slowly,
looking at me askance through half-closed lids, as if
to watch the effect of her words.</p>

<p>Was she warning or reproaching me? Or both?
What answer did she expect? &#8220;I trust nothing has
occurred in the interval to cause me to forfeit your good
opinion, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fan stopped a moment, as if she detected the
double meaning of my words. &#8220;Four months is a
long time to take to travel a thousand miles or so. I
had hoped to see you in Lisbon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you know that I was called from Paris
suddenly by my father&#8217;s illness. He lay for many
weeks between life and death, and it was absolutely
impossible for me to leave him even for a day. I
have come here at the first possible moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fan stopped again, abruptly this time, and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
lowered it slowly until it rested upon her lap; her
look was very serious and her eyes full of concern.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only these&mdash;these concessions which have
brought you here now, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; she replied
after a pause, her tone and look suggesting some degree
of nervous doubt of what my reply would be.</p>

<p>I returned her look and framed my answer carefully.
&#8220;I have been very careful to let every one know that&mdash;every
one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bit her lips and frowned, the concern in her
eyes deepened, and with a half-suppressed sigh she
turned away and began to fan herself slowly
again. I think she understood my meaning, but
before she could reply Miralda came up on Major
Sampayo&#8217;s arm. As she saw them approaching, the
viscontesse started and glanced quickly and nervously
at me with a look I could not read.</p>

<p>I rose to give my seat to Miralda, and her mother
sent Sampayo to find the visconte as she wished to
go home. Then she burst into one of her garrulous
speeches and did not cease speaking until Sampayo
returned with the visconte, when she hurried both
husband and Miralda away on the plea of an overpowering
headache. And Sampayo went with them.</p>

<p>I was both perplexed and excited as the result of
that short conversation. It was possible to read so
much both in her words and in her manner; and I was
puzzling over her real meaning when Sampayo re-entered
the room, glanced round hurriedly, and then
came straight across to me.</p>

<p>By the heavy frown in which his brows were drawn
together, his air of decision, and the expression of
his eyes when he saw me, I guessed that he had at
last succeeded in remembering me and had decided
to lose no time in finding out what I knew about him.</p>

<p>I had been watching him without looking up, and
when I did so, his look changed and he forced a smile:
a very poor effort to appear at ease.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;You know I was puzzling where we could have
met, Mr. Donnington. I have settled it at last. It
was in South Africa, and I wish to have a word or two
with you.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>SAMPAYO IS UNEASY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH Sampayo had obviously made up
his mind to ascertain at once whether I knew
anything about those black doings of his in South
Africa, I had not the slightest intention of satisfying
him.</p>

<p>There were many things I had to clear up before I
dealt with him; and, as matters stood, it suited me
much better that Miralda should be betrothed to
him than to any one else.</p>

<p>Sampayo was a big brute, much bigger than I, and
had once possessed great strength; but during his
years of comfort and wealth, fat had taken the place
of a good deal of his muscle. He had, however, retained
the air of bullying masterfulness and he now
tried to bully me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been frank with me, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said as he sat down. &#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you
wished purposely to mislead me, but you did so in
fact. You said that after the relief of Mafeking you
did not see any more of the war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, pardon me. I said I was sent down
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s much the same thing, sir; whereas,
from what you have told Mademoiselle Dominguez
it is clear that you went up country again and were
there at the end of things. You meant me to infer
the opposite, and I must ask you for your reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>At his hectoring tone I turned and looked him full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
in the eyes, and then turned away again with a shrug
of the shoulders, giving him no other reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard me, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took out my watch, glanced at the time, and replaced
it in my pocket very deliberately, and yawned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked you a question, sir, and I mean to
have an answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused and looked at him again more deliberately
than before. &#8220;Is it possible that you are addressing
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am addressing you,&#8221; he said with an
angry twist of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be good enough to drop that barrack-yard
tone, or say at once that you wish to force a quarrel
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew he was an arrant coward; and this was not
at all to his liking. After a slight pause he said in a
very different manner: &#8220;I may have spoken abruptly,
but I think I am entitled to an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221; I rapped out very sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether you intentionally misled me as to your
movements in South Africa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth can it matter to you or any one
else except myself where I went and where I did not
go in South Africa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you say you did not meet me out there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I say whether I did or did not? And
why should you be so anxious about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not anxious about it at all. No more so
than yourself. But if you did meet me and now deny
it, I have a right to ask your reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met hundreds of men, of course&mdash;thousands
indeed&mdash;and equally of course you may have been
one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not meant as an evasion, I hope,&#8221; he exclaimed,
losing his temper again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Major Sampayo!&#8221; I cried indignantly.</p>

<p>He gave a twirl to his moustaches and it looked as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
if he were going to quarrel in earnest. But he thought
better of it. &#8220;I meant no offence, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will take none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will remember your remark that you
never forget a face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean that I could identify at sight every
man I met in the campaign both on our side and among
the Boers. Of course there would have to be something
in the circumstances of the meeting which would serve
as a connecting link.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you do not remember me then?&#8221; he persisted.</p>

<p>It was awkward to answer this without a direct
lie, so I turned and had another steady look at him
for perhaps half a minute and then shook my head.
&#8220;Can you suggest anything likely to recall your features
to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes shifted uneasily under my scrutiny, and
he vented a little sigh of relief as he replied: &#8220;Of
course I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We both appear to be in the same difficulty, then.
Now that I look fixedly at your features, there is
something about them that I seem to know; but very
likely it is only due to the fact that I have seen you
two or three times to-night. Sampayo. Sampayo,&#8221;
I repeated, as if trying to recall the name, and then
shook my head again as if giving the matter up. &#8220;I
suppose we must take it that we have not met,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; I said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will excuse my curiosity, I trust, Mr. Donnington.
It may have seemed somewhat exaggerated to
you perhaps, but I am always anxious to meet any
one who was out there when I was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; I said, with a smile.</p>

<p>All the former uneasy suspicion leapt to life again
in his eyes. &#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked, quickly and eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just the same with me,&#8221; I answered lightly.
&#8220;It suggests a sort of comradeship, you know, chatting
over the old experiences.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Certainly, certainly,&#8221; he agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad to have an opportunity of exchanging
experiences with you some day. Only we mustn&#8217;t
begin, as we did just now, by firing broadsides at one
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, of course not. I am quite ashamed of my
heat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, major. On which side were you
in the war? Of course we&#8217;ve all buried the hatchet
long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not a combatant, Mr. Donnington. I was
making money and was very successful, I am glad to
say.&#8221; As I knew how he had made it, his boastful
self-complacent tone was amusing. &#8220;I rejoined the
army here on my return. And now there is another
topic on which I should like to say just a word or two.
You met Mademoiselle Dominguez last spring in Paris,
I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She was there with her mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are aware that she has done me the honour
to promise to be my wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. She herself told me. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted with a wave of the hand. &#8220;One
moment. It has been suggested to me to-night that
your present visit is in some respects a result of that
meeting?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;Considering that I have been only two
days in the city there appears to be a tremendous
amount of interest in my movements and actions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have proposed that we should see something
of each other in a friendly way, Mr. Donnington, and
I should be glad of your assurance that there is no
truth in the suggestion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, really!&#8221; I protested laughing again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon my frankness, but I wish to know where
we stand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not serious, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I am. And I must press the point.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;Well, really, I can&#8217;t take such a thing seriously at
all, Major Sampayo. You are naturally at liberty
to entertain any ideas you wish as to my presence in
Lisbon. But I am greatly astonished that you should
have even broached such a subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a right to put the question to you, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I disagree with you, and absolutely decline
to discuss it. You must have seen very little of the
English in South Africa if your experiences have led
you to believe that it is our custom to exchange
confidences with a stranger. Possibly after you and I
have had our proposed chat over our mutual experiences
out there and get to know one another better, we may
resume the subject. But not until then, if you please.
And now, I must bid you good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked very angry and malicious; but I did not
care for that. I was rather pleased than otherwise
that Miralda should have spoken of me to him in such
a way as to rouse his jealousy.</p>

<p>Sleep was almost out of the question for me that
night. I was in a positive fever of unrest.</p>

<p>Did Miralda care for me? If so, why had she promised
to marry Sampayo?</p>

<p>Over and over again I recalled every word that had
passed between us that evening, and every glance she
had given me. The first look at the moment of meeting
had been one of surprise, but I had read no other
feeling into it.</p>

<p>She had, however, been genuinely indignant when
she heard that only business had brought me. And
she had every right. I had carried matters far enough
in Paris to warrant her in believing I cared for her. I
had done everything I could to make my feelings plain.
Then I had gone without a word, had remained
away four months, and had now arrived &#8220;on business.&#8221;
It was only human nature that she should resent such
treatment.</p>

<p>Unexplained, my conduct was that of a cad and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
coxcomb. She might well believe that in Paris I
had spoken without meaning, had been amusing myself
with a flirtation, and had forgotten her as soon
as I had shaken the dust of the city off my feet. To
follow to Lisbon on such an errand as the visconte
had described and I had acquiesced in, was nothing
short of a brutal insult to her.</p>

<p>But while her resentment was white-hot, I had made
her see the truth. Her eyes had told me that she
understood. And the explanation had shifted the
axis of all her thoughts. I had come solely on her
account, hurrying to her at the first moment I was at
liberty to speak the words which had been impossible
in Paris, and&mdash;she had pledged herself to another man.</p>

<p>If she cared for me&mdash;always that if&mdash;she would
find herself playing the part she believed I had played.
The charge of inconstancy was transferred from my
shoulders to hers. And she had to face the task of
telling me the truth. Her sudden agitation was intelligible
enough. And she had undoubtedly been very
deeply moved. That thought was as balm in Gilead
to me.</p>

<p>I thought long and carefully over her manner at
that point. She had thrown off her agitation with
an effort and passed at once to the opposite extreme
of indifference; she had plunged into a discussion of
conventional trivialities of no interest to either of us,
and had deftly fended off my attempts to refer to
our former relations until she herself had mentioned
them in a way that implied they were past and buried.
And she had followed this with the news of the engagement.</p>

<p>The object might have been to spare us both from
embarrassment. But I read more in it. That she
should try to spare me pain was as natural as is the
light when the sun shines. But she had not spared me.
She would know that to refer to it in the light tone
she had used would add to the shock; and there had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
not been a word of preparation and not one of
regret.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>I thought I could see the reason. She wished me
to believe her heartless and unfeeling. She had regretted
her involuntary agitation on learning the truth,
lest I should believe she really cared. She had then
acted designedly and with the set purpose of making
me believe she had entirely forgotten the Paris episodes,
could speak of them with complete indifference, and
was happy in her engagement.</p>

<p>Again, why?</p>

<p>And again I thought I could see her reason. She
felt there were circumstances behind her betrothal
to Sampayo which shut out the possibility of its being
broken and she wished to drive home that conviction
upon me. She could not tell me what the facts and
influences were which had decided her; so she deliberately
blackened herself in my eyes, posing as a jilt
who had first encouraged me to hope and had then
thrown me over with a laugh and a careless toss of the
head.</p>

<p>But I knew her too well to accept any such self-caricature
as a true portrait, even without the help
of all I had heard from Inez, from Barosa, and from the
viscontesse.</p>

<p>Was it too late now to win? It might be; but it
certainly was not too late to make a big effort. And
such an effort I would make at once. If she had compromised
herself in this wretched conspiracy business
so far as to be under the thumb of Barosa and his
associates, her very safety demanded that I should strive
with might and main to break the power they held
over her and set her free from it.</p>

<p>But my fear was that some other compelling influence
was at work; and I looked to find it in her home.
It was not the viscontesse, I was certain of her;
but I knew very little yet of the visconte and nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
at all of the brother, Vasco, except that he was infatuated
with Inez and was being properly fooled by her.
I made my promised visit to the viscontesse on
the following afternoon hoping to be able to resume the
thread of the conversation at the reception. But no
opportunity offered. She had some friends and I could
not get a word with her alone; and Miralda did not
come in until just as I was leaving.</p>

<p>But I learnt something from the conversation. It
concerned mainly the personal side of the political
situation. Every one had a grievance against M.
Franco, the Dictator. In his zeal for economy he
had swept away a host of sinecure positions about
the Court; and had thus made enemies not only of
every one who had been paid for doing nothing and
their friends and relatives, but also of all who had been
looking forward to such payments.</p>

<p>The visconte himself had held one of the best of
these sinecures. He had been the royal cork-drawer
or napkin ring-holder-in-chief, or something equally
important, and the loss of the salary had been hotly
resented.</p>

<p>It sounded intensely ridiculous; but the viscontesse
herself was full of indignation; and her friends all
agreed and joined in abusing the Government with
a violence which, although entirely laughable, proved
how widespread was the discontent among those who
had been staunch in their loyalty.</p>

<p>It was on this feeling among the higher classes that
Barosa was working on behalf of the Pretender, Dom
Miguel.</p>

<p>Just as I was leaving, the viscontesse found a
moment to tell me she wished to have had more opportunity
of talking to me, so I promptly asked her to
come to luncheon on the <i>Stella</i> the next day, and she
was hesitating when Miralda came in. We were
standing near the door and she joined us. She
greeted me with just the same air of detached friendliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
she had shown on the previous evening; but
when her mother spoke of my invitation, she surprised
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be delightful, and I should like it above all
things&mdash;that is if the invitation is to include me, Mr.
Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And can we have a little run out to sea? I love
the sea you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shall be exactly as you wish,&#8221; I replied, and
having arranged that the launch was to be ready for
them at noon, I went off delighted at the prospect of
having Miralda and her mother to myself, for some
hours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>MIRALDA&#8217;S MASK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning was gloriously fine, and I was on
the <i>Stella</i> in good time to see that all was in readiness.
Old Bolton, my skipper, muttered something
about the wind shifting and that we should probably
have a change in the weather, but for once I didn&#8217;t
believe him, and just before noon I jumped into the
launch and went off in high spirits to fetch Miralda
and her mother.</p>

<p>Then came a decidedly disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>As I stepped on to the quay, Inez was waiting for
me, her servant standing by with wraps. With one
of her most radiant smiles she gave me her hand and
reminded me that I had invited her to see the yacht.
&#8220;So when I heard Miralda and the viscontesse were
going to-day, I thought this would be just a chance of
chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, delighted,&#8221; I replied very cordially.
I couldn&#8217;t very well tell her she wasn&#8217;t wanted; so
I buttoned up my chagrin and made the best
of it. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a little run out to
sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite sure I shall not upset your plans?&#8221;
she asked, knowing quite well that that was precisely
what she was doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lady, what plans do you think I have
that could be spoilt? There&#8217;s heaps of room on the
<i>Stella</i> for us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean with regard to Miralda, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
she said, dropping her light tone and fixing those queer
eyes of hers on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to give both the viscontesse and her
daughter a pleasant day&#8217;s outing. You don&#8217;t consider
that a very deadly plan, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may remember my warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I try to make it a rule to remember only the
pleasant things which are said to me by beautiful
ladies, contesse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you refuse to be warned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Against what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you pretend you do not know,&#8221; she retorted
impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you quite grasp the position. I am
in Lisbon on business which will detain me some little
time. Meanwhile, I am fortunate in having met some
old friends and made some new ones, and I am delighted
to have an opportunity of welcoming them on my
yacht. That is how matters stand. And any warning
against doing that, however well meant and by whomsoever
given, is really as little needed as if you or I
were to go to the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> captain and warn him against
hidden reefs out there on the open sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is against a hidden reef in an apparently open
sea that I am warning you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Bolton is a splendid seaman and
knows his charts, but a man of very few words, and
he would&mdash;just smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may smile if you will; but do you think I
should have forced myself upon you in this way without
reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is fortunate indeed upon whom such
pleasure is thus thrust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You cover your meaning with a jest&mdash;but I am too
much in earnest. I wish to be your friend. You
must not seek to interfere with Miralda&#8217;s marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon, but we are really getting too personal.
Let me suggest that we wait to discuss that lady until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
she is present. Ah, here they are,&#8221; I exclaimed, catching
sight of them. And then I had a little thrust at
Inez. &#8220;And you are fortunate, too. Lieutenant de
Linto is with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew how he must bore her; and she did not succeed
in disguising her chagrin. She had admitted that she
had come as a sort of watchdog; and the punishment
fitted the crime so aptly that I grinned. Nor was that
to be her only punishment, as matters turned out.
The skipper proved a true weather prophet, and Inez was
a desperately bad sailor.</p>

<p>She played her watchdog part cleverly; but it was
entirely superfluous. All the delightful anticipations
I had indulged in were killed by Miralda herself, whose
conduct perplexed me far more than on the previous
night.</p>

<p>Almost from the moment her dainty foot touched
the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> deck, she acted in a manner I could not
have deemed possible. She was very bright and laughed
and talked as if there were no such thing in the world
as care and trouble. She treated me as if I were a mere
acquaintance whom she was just pleased to meet
again. Nothing more.</p>

<p>But it was not that which so pained me. She spoke
freely of her visit to Paris, referring now to her mother
and again to me in regard to little episodes of the time
there, and doing it all without a suggestion of restraint.
Then in a hard tone and with jarring half-boastful
laughter, she began to jest about her conquests. She
named several men, who, as I knew, had admired her;
mimicked their ways, ridiculed their attentions, and
freely admitted that she had flirted with them, because
&#8220;one must amuse oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>If any man had told me that she was capable of such
conduct I think I should have knocked him down.
But I heard it all myself. I could scarcely believe
my own eyes and ears. The last belief in the back of
my mind was that she could be the callous, heartless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
coquette she was showing herself, luring men to her by
her beauty only to laugh at them for believing in her,
and descending to the depths of talking about it to
others in a vein of self-glorification.</p>

<p>The luncheon gong interrupted but did not check
her, and as I sat listening in silence she appealed
to me more than once to confirm some little ridiculous
trait of some one or other of the men she had &#8220;scalped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inez saw and rejoiced at my discomfiture, but retribution
was at hand for her. When we sat down to
luncheon the sea was as smooth as the table-cloth,
but when we reached the deck again the weather had
changed and a heavy bank of clouds to the south
threatened a capful of wind. And even this served
to show Miralda in a new light.</p>

<p>She heard me tell the skipper to return. &#8220;Is it
going to be rough? I hope so. I love a rough sea.
Don&#8217;t go back yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inez and Vasco protested vigorously.</p>

<p>Miralda looked at them both and shrugged her shoulders,
and then turned to me. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see why we
should spoil our pleasure for them, do you?&#8221; she asked
with a laugh that was half a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to cut your pleasure short, but I think
we had better return,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;People look so silly when they are ill;&#8221; and with an
unpleasant laugh she crossed to the side.</p>

<p>When the wind came and the <i>Stella</i> began to roll,
Inez hurried away, followed directly by Vasco.</p>

<p>The viscontesse had been very quiet all the time, and
although the motion of the yacht did not appear to
upset her, she said she would rather lie down and
asked Miralda to go with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be unreasonable, mother,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;I am enjoying every moment of it. You don&#8217;t want
to shut me up in a stuffy cabin. But take my hat with
you, and bring me a wrap of some sort, and my
cloak.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>The unfeeling words and the tone in which they were
uttered, stung me like the knots of a whip lash. I gave
my arm to the viscontesse and took her below and
installed her comfortably on a sofa in the saloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miralda loves a rough sea, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; she
said, as she pointed to the wraps for me to take on deck.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stay with me; I am going to take an old woman&#8217;s
privilege and have a nap.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the things in silence and returned to Miralda.</p>

<p>She stood by the bulwarks her eyes intent on the
troubled waters; a stray lock or two of her hair had
been freed by the breeze, and her face was radiant with
delight. She revelled in the scene. A veritable
incarnation of vigorous youth and bewitching beauty.</p>

<p>She turned as I reached her side. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it glorious,
Mr. Donnington? I suppose I may stay on deck? I
shan&#8217;t be in the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The whole yacht is yours to be where you will, of
course,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always say such pleasant things. I remember
that knack of yours. Help me on with this cloak,&#8221;
she added with a coquettish glance. &#8220;There, how do
I look?&#8221; she asked when she had adjusted the wrap,
gracefully, as all her acts were. &#8220;And now you must
find me a corner where I shan&#8217;t be quite blown away,&#8221;
she commanded.</p>

<p>I found her a corner and installed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall want two chairs, of course, and then we
can have a long chat like we used to in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had had quite enough of Paris already, if she
meant to continue to talk in her former strain. But I
fetched another chair and sat down.</p>

<p>Then she laughed suddenly and almost boisterously.
&#8220;Do you know I really believe my mother wanted me
to go and stop with her? She can be a terrible nuisance.
Imagine me pinned up there. Sympathize with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The viscontesse told me she hoped to get to sleep,&#8221;
I replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;Then wasn&#8217;t it selfish of her? As if I was going to
miss this beautiful sea just because she feels bad and
has a headache. Absolutely preposterous, wasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; and she laughed again.</p>

<p>I looked round at her and made no reply.</p>

<p>She returned the look as if surprised at my silence.
Then her eyes lighted and her lips parted. &#8220;Oh, I
remember now, of course. It was you who always put
on that mournful look&mdash;funereally gloomy&mdash;when I used
to do things which shocked your English propriety. I
was thinking it was that Graf von Holstein&mdash;that long-faced
German who would insist upon giving me
flowers I did not want and then expected me to dance
with him in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had given her flowers and asked her to dance when
she wore them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very unreasonable, mademoiselle,&#8221; I said after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, men are always like that. They all seem
to think that because a girl amuses herself and dances
once or twice with them, they have made a conquest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man is of course unreasonable to believe in a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a delightfully cynical platitude. Isn&#8217;t the
sea getting up quickly? Poor mother! I am afraid
you won&#8217;t tempt her on the yacht again.&#8221; Again she
laughed, and added: &#8220;And that&#8217;s a nuisance, for
I love the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned unexpectedly and caught a look in her eyes
as they were bent on me, which she had not meant
me to see. And then I thought I understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that was it,&#8221; I said quietly. I myself
could smile now.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was what, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; she asked as
a sort of challenge; adding, with an attempt to resume
her former expression of reckless frivolity: &#8220;that sounds
like a conundrum, doesn&#8217;t it? And they are such
stupid things.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;I believe I have the answer to the bigger conundrum.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the grave Englishman again,&#8221; she jested,
with a toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. &#8216;Miralda&#8217;s Englishman,&#8217;&#8221; I answered, holding
her eyes with mine and speaking slowly and deliberately.</p>

<p>It was great daring, but I felt that I must strip
away this mask of heartless raillery which galled and
pained me beyond endurance. I would know the
truth at any cost. If this coquette of flouts and jibes
who laughed at men with one breath and made light of
even her mother&#8217;s sufferings with the next, was the
real woman whom I had set in the inmost shrine of my
heart, the sooner I was away the better.</p>

<p>The mask fell, but not at once.</p>

<p>She met my gaze steadily, almost defiantly, and the
blood rushed to her face as she read my look and
strove to force a laugh and utter a jest in reply. But
the words would not come.</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand me,&#8221; I said, in the same deliberate
tone. &#8220;You are either the most heartless jilt who ever
trifled with the best feelings of men in order to be able
to boast of your triumphs afterwards, or you are
deliberately playing the part for some purpose of your own.
God forbid that I should accept your self-accusation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began and half rose. But the
reaction came then. The crimson faded from her face,
leaving it white and strained. She hid it behind her
hands as she sank back in the chair, her head lowered,
trembling in agitation.</p>

<p>I was answered and without a word I rose and left
her that she might be alone while she recovered her
self-command.</p>

<p>With a rare feeling of exultation I renewed all that
had passed in the light of my new knowledge. She
had set herself purposely to disgust me with the gibbering
caricature she had drawn of herself. And my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
heart thrilled and my blood raced through my veins
as I saw that my reading of her conduct on the evening
of the reception had been right.</p>

<p>Many minutes passed as I paced the deck deciding
the course I would take, and not until I had settled it
did I return to her.</p>

<p>She had regained her self-possession, but as I sat
down she looked at me questioningly and nervously
as if fearing how I should refer to the secret I had surprised.
But there was not a vestige of the mask left.
She was just herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is dropping again already,&#8221; I said in a
casual tone.</p>

<p>Her eyes thanked me, but she made no reply and
sank back in her chair with an air of relief. I uttered
a few commonplaces about the weather and the yacht,
worked round to the subject of Lisbon and then to that
of my supposed purpose in the city. For once the
concessions were of use, as they enabled me to describe
my own acts and intentions in regard to her as if I
were referring to the concessions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I shall find difficulties&mdash;indeed the whole
position is entirely different from my anticipations. I
ought to have been here earlier. But it was impossible.
After my father&#8217;s stroke of paralysis which took me at a
moment&#8217;s notice from Paris, he lay between life and
death for three months; and although I was as anxious
then as now about these concessions and should have
come at once to Lisbon, I could not leave him for any
purpose, however vital and important to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; she murmured, not raising her
eyes from the deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now that I am here, of course I shall not abandon
my efforts to obtain them until they are actually in the
possession of some one else. I have heard that they
are promised, but I shall not regard that as an actual
barrier.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved slightly and answered in a voice firm but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
low: &#8220;From what I have heard you will only be
wasting time and effort, Mr. Donnington. You will
not be allowed to&mdash;to obtain them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the unsettled condition of political matters
here, the cabals and intrigues and so on, will interfere
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; she said very deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean there are obstacles of which I know
nothing. As for those I do know, I care nothing for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends upon what you do know.&#8221; Every word
was uttered in a low tense monotone, full charged with
suppressed feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, as I say, that they are promised to some
one else, but that doesn&#8217;t count with me. I know
too that they are involved in the secret plans of some
of those whose political objects are opposed to the
professed objects of some leaders of the League of Portugal.
But that also I will not regard as an insuperable barrier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has not occurred to you that private influences
may be at work which those who might wish to help
you are powerless to resist, and which make your quest
absolutely unattainable and impossible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit I have had fears of that, but I shall not
believe it impossible until I know what those influences
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you that I know it to be impossible, Mr.
Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me more&mdash;what these private influences
are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot without speaking of things that must be
secret; without revealing a story of shame and crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I sacrifice an object which is more to
me than any I have ever desired because another person
has done wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not even seek to discover it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;On the contrary, I will know it within the next few
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew it, you would recognize the truth of
what I have said. But if you will take advice, you
will use those next few hours to be many leagues on
your way to England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go when I said&mdash;when the concessions are
actually in the possession of those who seek them.
Not one hour, not one minute before.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was silent for a while and then for the first time
since I had rejoined her she sat forward and looked
at me. &#8220;Once in those days when we met in Paris,
you said you would do anything I asked you? Does
that promise hold good now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I wish you to leave Lisbon at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;No, anything but that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid,&#8221; she murmured, and leant back in
her seat, with a sigh of despair; and we both remained
silent.</p>

<p>Some time later the skipper&#8217;s voice roused me. &#8220;We
shall drop anchor in about quarter of an hour, Mr.
Donnington,&#8221; he said as he passed.</p>

<p>Miralda rose with a sigh, started to leave me and
then returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one thing you spoke of which I must
make clear. I am no revolutionary, as you hinted, but I
am not free. I have been compromised against my will
and I cannot break the bonds. But don&#8217;t think me a
rebel, because you see me associated with those who are.&#8221;</p>

<p>And without waiting for any reply, she turned and
hurried away.</p>

<p>When the anchor was dropped and the launch waiting
to take us all on shore, she came up with the viscontesse
and was again wearing a mask. But a different one
now. She laughed and chatted brightly, but without
the hardness or bitterness of the earlier time.</p>

<p>I was once more the stranger. I gathered that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
mask was now worn to mislead Inez, for when we shook
hands, although her words of thanks were just those
of common courtesy, there was an expression in the
eyes and a simultaneous pressure of the fingers eloquent
of the altered relations between us.</p>

<p>Wishing to be entirely alone I returned to the <i>Stella</i>
and remained there thinking and speculating and
planning.</p>

<p>I did not reach my rooms until late and found a
letter awaiting me which made me rub my eyes in
astonishment.</p>

<p>It was from Volheno, thanking me for some information
I had given him and saying that it had been acted
upon the previous night with excellent results. &#8220;It
will of course be considered by the Government when
we come to decide the matter of the Beira concessions;
and I need scarcely say that if you can give us any more
information of the same kind, you will render the
Government a great service.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had given no information and would see him in
the morning and explain. The man was mad; and I
tossed the letter down and went off to bed.</p>

<p>I must have slept heavily after the day in the fresh
air, for I was roused by some one shaking me roughly.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes to find the lights switched up and
the police in my room. Two of them were searching
the room and a third stood over me and ordered me
sternly to get up and dress and be quick about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; I asked, blinking like an owl
in the sudden light.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are arrested. That&#8217;s what it means. Dress
and come with us, unless you want to go as you are;&#8221;
and the fellow gave point to his words by stripping off
the bedclothes.</p>

<p>A curious sequel, this, to Volheno&#8217;s letter.</p>

<small>THE INTERROGATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DIGNITY in a nightshirt is impossible; so I rolled
off the bed and dressed myself quickly.</p>

<p>Why I should be arrested I could not imagine, unless
it was in some way the outcome of that row in the
streets. Even if that were so, the thing could not be
serious. I had been mistaken for one of the mob and
nearly clubbed by a policeman; but it was scarcely
likely I should be punished because he had missed
his aim. Probably some fool or other had blundered,
and the whole thing was just a mistake.</p>

<p>I was disposed to smile at it, therefore. I might
lose half a night&#8217;s sleep; but that was no great matter;
and as a recompense I should have an experience at
first hand of police methods under a dictator.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I supposed to have done?&#8221; I asked the
man who had awakened me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see.&#8221; He jerked the words out with
scowling gruffness.</p>

<p>&#8220;In England when a man is arrested like this it&#8217;s
usual to tell him the reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to make the affair more unpleasant
than necessary by talking in that tone. The whole
thing&#8217;s a mistake; but I don&#8217;t blame you. Why
growl at me, therefore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who ordered this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry.&#8221; And he accompanied the word with an
emphatic gesture.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; I said with a grin; and as it was
evident I should not get anything out of him, I finished
dressing in silence. In the meanwhile the two men
finished their search of the drawers and wardrobe and
my luggage; and we went to my sitting-room.</p>

<p>This had also been ransacked; and the work must
have been done before they roused me. &#8220;Your men
certainly understand their work,&#8221; I said; for the
search had been very thorough; &#8220;but you might
have put some of the things back in their places.
If you&#8217;ll give me a couple of minutes, I&#8217;ll do it myself,
however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Short, sharp, and peremptory this, from
the fellow who had spoken before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then wake my servant&mdash;his room is through the
kitchen at the end of the hall and up a short flight of
stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Same tone from the same speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Then I&#8217;ll leave a line here for him to
let him know what has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve gone mad, or bolted, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come.&#8221; He was quite a master of monosyllabic
dialogue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be hanged if I will,&#8221; I flung back at him
angrily.</p>

<p>But as he pulled out a revolver and made me understand&mdash;without
even a monosyllable this time&mdash;that I should
be shot if I didn&#8217;t, I decided not to be obstinate.</p>

<p>As we left the door of the house a vehicle drove up
and I was bundled into it, none too gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence.&#8221; The word was so fiercely uttered that
I saw no use in arguing the point. I sat still therefore
wondering to which prison we were going and what
steps I should be allowed to take to get the matter
explained. The simplest course would be to send a line
to Volheno; but the arrest was really an outrage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
and in the interests of other Englishmen in the city,
a row ought to be made about it by the British
authorities.</p>

<p>I was hesitating to which of the two quarters I would
send, when the carriage stopped before a large private
house, the door of which was instantly opened and I
was hurried inside. Obviously I was expected.</p>

<p>The three men took me up a broad flight of stairs and
halted on the landing. The man of monosyllables went
into a room at the back of the house, taking with him
some papers which I concluded he had brought from
my rooms; and after perhaps a couple of minutes he
reopened the door and signed to us to enter.</p>

<p>Seated at a large official-looking table was a man in
evening dress reading the letter from Volheno, the
receipt of which had so puzzled me on my return from
the <i>Stella</i>. To my intense surprise he rose and offered
me his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have had to disturb you, Mr.
Donnington, and am extremely obliged to you for
having come so promptly,&#8221; he said with a courteous
smile and an appearance of great cordiality.</p>

<p>This was too much for my gravity. I looked at him
in bewilderment, and then laughed. &#8220;As a matter
of fact your men didn&#8217;t give me any alternative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; he replied glancing from
me to the police, who looked rather sheepish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I was arrested. These men got into my
rooms&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how&mdash;hauled me out of bed,
would tell me nothing, except that I was under arrest;
and dragged me here. That&#8217;s why I came so promptly,&#8221;
I said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean, you?&#8221; he thundered at the
police, his eyes flaming his anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only ordered to bring him here, and I
brought him,&#8221; answered the man of few words, in a
hang-dog, surly tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven, it is infamous. Do you mean to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
me that you never delivered M. Volheno&#8217;s letter to
this gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You blockhead, you fool, you thing of wood, get
out of the room. You&#8217;ll hear of this again, all of you.
A set of clumsy mules without the brains of an idiot
amongst you;&#8221; and he stormed away at them furiously.</p>

<p>I chuckled at their discomfiture while admiring at
the same time the excellent variety of abusive epithet
possessed by their angry superior.</p>

<p>&#8220;These blunders are the curse and despair of public
men,&#8221; he exclaimed as he slammed the door after them
and returned to his seat. &#8220;Of course the whole thing
is an egregious blunder, Mr. Donnington, and I tender
you at once a most profound apology.&#8221;</p>

<p>I considered it judicious to mount the high horse.
&#8220;It is a very disgraceful affair, sir, and naturally I
shall report the matter to the representatives of my
country here and demand satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope you will not find it necessary to do that,&#8221;
he replied in a tone of great concern. &#8220;I would not
have had it occur for any consideration in the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man in my position is not likely to submit tamely
to such an infamous outrage; and I cannot see my way
to have such a thing hushed up,&#8221; I declared with a very
grandiose air. &#8220;It might have occurred to any countryman
of mine whose lack of influence might render
him unable to protect himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us talk it over;&#8221; he urged; and we did at
some length until I allowed myself to be mollified by
his apologies, and agreed not to take any step without
first seeing Volheno.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now perhaps you will have the goodness to
explain why I was asked so courteously&#8221;&mdash;I dwelt
on the phrase and he winced&mdash;&#8220;to come here at this
time of night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was really M. Volheno&#8217;s suggestion, Mr. Donnington.
You see I am in evening dress and I was fetched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
home hurriedly from a social gathering as the result
of some discoveries the police have made. I may
explain I am the magistrate&mdash;d&#8217;Olliveira is my name:
you may perhaps have heard it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not. I never discuss public matters here,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I was saying, some important discoveries
have been made and a number of arrests&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the same nature as mine?&#8221; I interjected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please,&#8221; he replied with a deprecatory smile
and wave of the hand. &#8220;A number of genuine arrests
have been made and I am going to interrogate the
prisoners. M. Volheno thinks it very probable that
you can identify&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what?&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We believe that they are some of the men who
frequented the revolutionary headquarters in the Rua
Catania about which you gave him information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment. I never gave M. Volheno any
information of any sort whatever, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave me a very shrewd glance and his eyes were
hard and piercing. &#8220;Surely&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand,
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am beginning to, I think. I had a letter from
him to-night&mdash;I think your clever police brought it
away with them&mdash;in which he thanked me for having
done something of the sort. But he is under a complete
delusion. I am going to see him in the morning
and tell him so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the letter?&#8221; I nodded as he held it up.
&#8220;With your permission I&#8217;ll read it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do with it,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is certainly very strange,&#8221; he muttered to himself
when he finished. &#8220;He clearly has had a letter
from you and this is the reply to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort is clear, sir, and I&#8217;ll beg you
to be so good as not to imply that I should lie about
it either to you or to him,&#8221; I rapped out hotly. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
have had as much from your people as I can stand for
one night. I tell you point-blank that I did not write
any letter either to M. Volheno or any one else giving
any such information as he and you appear to think;
nor did I tell any one anything of the sort. I declare
that on my word of honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>His look was very stern. &#8220;This is an official matter,
of course, Mr. Donnington, and you must not regard
anything I say as reflecting in any way upon your
word. But I am taken entirely by surprise, of course,
and equally of course the matter cannot rest here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a little gesture of protest and sat thinking.
&#8220;Do you say that you had no such information about
the house in the Rua Catania?&#8221; he asked after the
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I know and what I don&#8217;t know concerns no
one but myself, sir,&#8221; I replied firmly. &#8220;I decline
to answer your question.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders significantly. &#8220;This
may be more serious than I thought. You will see
that. I think, perhaps, I had better send for M.
Volheno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can send for the Dictator himself if you like.
It makes no sort of difference to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was much perplexed what to do and at length
took a paper from one of the pigeon holes of the table,
folded it very carefully and then held it out to me. &#8220;Is
that your signature, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; He put the
question in his severest magisterial manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s uncommonly like it, I admit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he grunted with evident satisfaction. &#8220;Have
you any objection to write a few lines in my presence
and at my dictation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever, provided you undertake to destroy
what I write in my presence afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled grimly and then rose and waved me to sit
at the desk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked, looking up pen in hand at the
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Write as follows, please.&#8221;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;It may influence your Government in granting
the Beira concessions which I seek,&#8221; I wrote as he
dictated, &#8220;if I give you some information which I
have learnt. Let your men raid at once the house
237, Rua da Catania. It is one of the headquarters
of the revolutionary party. I shall be in a position
to tell you much more in a few days. Of course
you will keep the fact of my writing thus absolutely
secret.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I resumed my former seat and he sat down at the
desk again and very carefully compared what I had
written with the letter the signature of which he had
shown to me. The work of comparison occupied a long
time, and now and again he made a note of some point
which struck him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You gave me a pledge on your word of honour
just now, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he said, at length turning
a very stern face to me. &#8220;Are you willing that
I treat with you on that basis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then will you pledge me your word to imitate to
the utmost of your ability a line of the writing of this
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again I took his seat and he folded the letter so
that only one line was visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rua de Catania. It is one of the headquarters,&#8221;
was the line.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little unusual for a magistrate to give lessons
in forgery, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; I asked as I studied the writing
and then wrote as good an imitation of it as I could,
and returned to my seat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Again he made an examination letter by letter, very
laboriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked, growing impatient at his long
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am greatly perplexed, Mr. Donnington. And I
must ask you one or two questions. How did you
come to know of the house mentioned here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a bit, please. I have complied with the test
you put; what is the result? And what is my position now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I put my questions in a perfectly friendly spirit&mdash;as
M. Volheno would put them were he here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that writing test?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will discuss it freely with you afterwards. I
promise you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you nothing about the house.
Evidently the writer of that letter knows that I learnt
what I know by accident; but what I know I cannot
reveal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you take that line. Whom did you
meet there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you meet a Dr. Barosa there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you rescue a lady from any of the men belonging
to the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer. I will not answer any questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that lady the Contesse Inez Inglesia?&#8221;</p>

<p>I held my tongue.</p>

<p>He asked many questions of a similar nature, surprising
me considerably by his knowledge of my movements
on that night and since; but I maintained a
stolid silence.</p>

<p>I could see his anger rising at his repeated failure
to extract any reply, and he sat thinking with pursed
lips and a heavy frown. &#8220;I will make one further
effort. I ask you as a personal favour to M. Volheno
to reply to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;If M. Volheno were fifty times as great a friend of
mine as he is, and begged me on his knees, I would not
do it, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>His frown deepened at this. &#8220;Then you must understand
that if you persist in refusing, you may as
well abandon all thought of obtaining the concessions
you seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil with the concessions. If Volheno
or you or any one else in the business think you are
going to bribe me with them to do spy work for you,
the sooner you disabuse your minds of that insulting
rot the better,&#8221; I answered letting my temper go.
&#8220;And now I&#8217;ve finished with this thing and want
to go back to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot take the responsibility of allowing you
to leave, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he snapped back sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you dare to detain me as a
prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your temper, sir, and remember that I
am a law officer of His Majesty the King of Portugal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then as a British subject I claim my right to communicate
at once with the British Legation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That request will be considered, and if it is thought
desirable, complied with. Not otherwise. This is a
political matter. It is known to us that you have held
communication with these dangerous revolutionaries;
you are seeking to shield them by refusing information;
and the only inference I can draw is that you do so
because you are in collusion with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that I burst out laughing. &#8220;Infer what you like
and be hanged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may find this is no laughing matter, sir,&#8221; he
cried, getting white with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so may you, magistrate though you are.
Kidnapping Englishmen is not a game your Government
can play at with impunity, my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send for M. Volheno,&#8221; he said as he rose;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
&#8220;and in the meantime shall detain you here on my
own responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he favoured me with a scowl and went
out of the room, leaving me to speculate where I was
going to finish the night.</p>

<p>The odds appeared to be in favour of a prison cell
rather than my own bed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE matter was obviously more serious than I
had at first believed; and I realized that, as
the authorities were aware that I knew Barosa and
Inez were really revolutionaries, I might have some
difficulty in convincing them that my knowledge had
been innocently obtained. And two unpleasant possibilities
loomed ahead.</p>

<p>This hot-headed magistrate, if left to himself, might
pack me off to one of their prisons; and any one who
has seen a Portuguese prison will understand my
dread of such a step.</p>

<p>The condition of these dens of filth, wretchedness,
and abomination is a black stain upon the Portuguese
administration. Take the lowest and dirtiest type
of the worst doss-house in London, multiply its foulest
features ten times, overcrowd it with verminous
brawling scum to two or three times the extent of
what you would consider its utmost limit of accommodation,
and stir up the whole with gaoler-bullies
who have all graduated with the highest honours in
the school of brutality and blackguardism; and you
have a typical Portuguese gaol.</p>

<p>A sojourn in one of those human hells was one
possible result for me; and the other was even more
distasteful&mdash;that a sufficiently grave view might be
taken of the case to have me ordered out of the country.</p>

<p>I was railing at my ill-luck in ever having learnt
the facts which threatened one of these alternatives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
when the murmurs of many voices started below in
the house swelled as it came up the stairs and culminated
in a chorus of threats and groans and curses just
outside as the door was opened and a man was thrust
violently into the room and went staggering across
the floor.</p>

<p>He had been in the wars. His clothes were all disordered,
his collar was flying loose, his coat was torn,
and he had the crumpled look which a man is apt to
have at two o&#8217;clock in the morning after a night on
the general rampage finished up with a scrimmage
with the police.</p>

<p>His first act was inspired by the sheer stupidity of
rage. He turned and shook his fists at the door and
swore copiously. He had quite a natural gift for
cursing, and gave free vent to it. Then he began
to put his clothes straight and saw me for the first
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallo, you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Both question and answer sounded a little
superfluous under the circumstances, but it turned
out that he recognized me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they want you?&#8221; He swore again as he recalled
his own experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those infernal brutes out there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean the police?&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of replying he gave me a sharp look and then
came up close and peered inquiringly at me with his
head slightly on one side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Waiting to go somewhere else; but where, seems
a little doubtful at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect they&#8217;d take you yet.
They&#8217;re all fools&mdash;the whole lot of them. I told
them to give you more rope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not that sort;&#8221; and he made a gesture to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
indicate hanging. Then wrinkling his brows he added
suspiciously: &#8220;You didn&#8217;t come of your own accord,
did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ll make things a bit plainer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you did, you&#8217;d better tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any telling to be done you&#8217;d better start
it,&#8221; I said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;They got me to-night&mdash;&mdash; Here, aren&#8217;t you interested
in Miralda Dominguez?&#8221; he broke off lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting rather interested in you. Who are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He winked knowingly. He was quite young, dark
and not bad-looking, except that he had sly ferretty
eyes. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know, eh? You don&#8217;t remember,
eh? Is that your line? Or are you on the same
tack as I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your particular tack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have guessed it I should think. They&#8217;ve
got about twenty of Barosa&#8217;s people here and about
half a dozen police to look after them. Somebody
let &#8217;em know that I meant to save myself by telling
things, and the brutes nearly tore me to bits as I came
up. The devils;&#8221; and once more he cursed them
luridly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll make it hot for some of them,&#8221;
he added, his little close-set eyes gleaming viciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re an informer, are you? Well, I don&#8217;t
like your breed, I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I know you, of course. You&#8217;re Ralph Donnington,
the reputed English millionaire. I know;&#8221;
and he winked again. &#8220;I saw you at the de Pinsara
house the other night with Barosa. He told me you
were all right. I had to tell them about you, of course.
They&#8217;ve sucked me about as dry as a squeezed orange.
Barosa told me you were interested in Miralda Dominguez&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not talk any more,&#8221; I interposed sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know it&#8217;s all up. They&#8217;ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Barosa and Contesse Inglesia, and Lieutenant de Linto
and heaps of others. But not his sister yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>I affected not to hear this and took out a cigarette
and lighted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you spare me one?&#8221;</p>

<p>I put the case in my pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want to get her out of the mess you&#8217;d
better do as I&#8217;ve done. Out with everything. It&#8217;s
the only way. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet. &#8220;Look here, if you talk any
more to me I shall act as deputy for those men outside,
and when I&#8217;ve finished with you, you&#8217;ll find it difficult
to talk at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>That stopped him and he slunk away to the door
and flopped into a chair staring at me and muttering
to himself, probably cursing me as he had cursed
the others.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards M. d&#8217;Olliveira came back with a
couple of police, and said that Volheno was coming
and would arrive in about half an hour. Then he
ordered the first of the prisoners to be brought in.</p>

<p>The informer jumped away from the door as if it
was on fire and crossed to the other side of the magistrate&#8217;s
desk.</p>

<p>The proceedings were very short&mdash;apparently for
no purpose other than identification.</p>

<p>I glanced at the prisoner and recognized him as one
of the men I had seen at the house in the Rua Catania.
He was the scoundrel named Henriques, who had been
going to strike Inez when I had entered.</p>

<p>He looked at the young informer with a scowl of
hate and hissed out an execration.</p>

<p>The magistrate appealed to me first. &#8220;You know
this man, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; he said sharply, and
the fellow turned a scowling face on me with a half
defiant and wholly malicious expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I? If you know that, why ask me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t trifle with me, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;He knows him well enough. He saw him that
night in the Rua Catania,&#8221; broke in the informer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue,&#8221; was the rough rebuke. &#8220;Do
you deny it, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can draw what inference you please. I decline
to be questioned by you or any one,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot too strongly warn you, Mr. Donnington,
that any refusal to identify this man and any of his
companions will render you suspect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite ready to accept the responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned then to the informer and accepted his
identification, made a note of it, and sent the prisoner
away in custody.</p>

<p>Another of the men I had seen in the house was
brought in, and a very similar scene was enacted,
except that I held my tongue. Three more followed
and then a pause.</p>

<p>When the door opened next time Dr. Barosa was
brought in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know this man, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; asked
d&#8217;Olliveira.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I had the pleasure of meeting him at the
house of the Marquis de Pinsara. Good evening, Dr.
Barosa;&#8221; and I rose and would have shaken hands
with him had not the police prevented me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see him in Rua Catania?&#8221; asked the
magistrate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you I met him elsewhere. That is my
answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am obliged to you, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; said Barosa,
&#8220;but unfortunately no good purpose can be gained
by your keeping silent about anything you know. You
can only compromise yourself; and as everything
is now known to these people, I release you from the
pledge of secrecy you gave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; broke in d&#8217;Olliveira, gloatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil with you and your grunts of satisfaction,&#8221;
I cried hotly, turning on him. &#8220;If you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
want to bribe or frighten information out of people,
do it with carrion like that young brute at your side.
Don&#8217;t try it with Englishmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you use that tone to me, sir?&#8221; he exclaimed,
getting up.</p>

<p>Barosa interposed. &#8220;I beg you not to compromise
yourself further. It may lead you into a very false
position and can do no good either to me or to the
Contesse Inglesia. It is known quite well that you were
present in the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, doctor. If you like to tell these
people what they want to know, it&#8217;s your affair not
mine. As for my part, I have friends quite influential
enough not only to protect me, but to make it
unpleasant for this hectoring gentleman here. I am
sorry to see you in this mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands. &#8220;It is the fortune of war.&#8221;
Then he turned to the magistrate. &#8220;Now, sir are you
satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause and d&#8217;Olliveira said: &#8220;Yes,
absolutely.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I had the most amazing surprise of my life.</p>

<p>The magistrate waved his hand and a dozen or more
men, police and prisoners mingled together, crowded
into the room, and the eyes of every man present
were directed on me.</p>

<p>Barosa stepped forward and offered me his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must forgive us, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive you. What the deuce for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For having tested you in this drastic way. You
will admit the evidence that you had betrayed us to
the authorities was very strong&mdash;a letter in your
name to your friend M. Volheno and his to you, thanking
you for the information, was found in your rooms.
I made the inquiries you suggested and satisfied myself
of your absolute good faith. I would not believe
you had broken your word, but my friends here
insisted, and then this test was planned.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I stopped in sheer astonishment
as the truth dawned on me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that this was all an elaborate pretence.
There is no magistrate here and no police. We are
all comrades in the one cause, and after what has
passed no one of us will ever distrust you again. I
say that for all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly for me,&#8221; said the magistrate.</p>

<p>&#8220;For us all,&#8221; came a chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you fooled me all right,&#8221; I said, gaping at
them for a moment like a bumpkin at a wax-work
show, for the suddenness of the thing almost bewildered
me. Then I laughed and added: &#8220;It seems I
was sitting on a bag with more gunpowder in it than I
knew. Which do you expect me to do&mdash;thank you
for your present confidence or curse you for your former
distrust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The matter is ended, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; said
Barosa. &#8220;And you have as much reason as we have
to be glad the result is what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if it had gone the other way?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and replied very drily:
&#8220;You had better not ask perhaps. At such a crisis
our methods with those who betray us cannot be&mdash;pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which reminds me,&#8221; I said, turning to the man
who had played the magistrate&mdash;whose real name
I learnt was Sebastian Maral&mdash;&#8220;you&#8217;ve asked me
plenty of questions and there are one or two I should
like to ask you. How did you get that spurious letter
I was supposed to write to M. Volheno?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better discuss those matters alone,&#8221;
interposed Barosa; and then all but we three left the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was such a letter really written?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. That which you received was M.
Volheno&#8217;s reply to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then some one did give away that Rua Catania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
house? Who is it? Do you suspect any one in
particular?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Barosa, his look darkening as he added:
&#8220;But we shall of course find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you can help us, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; said
Maral. &#8220;The writer is obviously an enemy of yours.
Can you make a suggestion?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was fairly confident that I knew, but it did not
suit me to say so. &#8220;I have not had time yet to make
any enemies unless some one is after the Beira concessions
and thought this an easy way of getting rid of a
competitor. Will you show me the original of that
letter you dictated to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at Barosa who nodded, and it was given
to me.</p>

<p>I made a discovery then. Either from inadvertence
or as a proof of confidence in me, Maral left on the
letter, where it was pinned to the top, a strip of paper
with half a dozen words followed by the numerals
&#8220;134.&#8221;</p>

<p>I compared the handwriting of the letter with my
own copy of the dictated part and saw at once how
clumsy a forgery it was. My signature was done
well enough; the writer probably had a signature of
mine and had practised it until the resemblance was
striking. But the attempt to write an entire autograph
letter was a conspicuous failure.</p>

<p>Then while pretending to continue my examination
of the writing, I worried over the curious superscription,
and it dawned upon me at length that it was a message
of some sort in cypher.</p>

<p>As the other two had their heads together in a very
earnest discussion, I unpinned the cypher message and
rolled it up in my palm. Its nature convinced me
that it was inadvertence not confidence which had led
Maral to let me see it, and I took the risk of his not
noticing its absence even if I could not do what I now
very much wished&mdash;retain the letter itself for a time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;I wish to keep this letter, Dr. Barosa,&#8221; I said
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is not possible. It has to be
returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can get over that easily enough. You are
probably as eager as I am to know who wrote it. As
for returning it, I&#8217;ll write out another in my own hand,
and that one can be returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some demur this was agreed to; and I went
to the desk and wrote the duplicate letter, and was
careful to fold it up so that Maral should not miss the
strip of paper I had annexed.</p>

<p>While I was writing, Barosa paced up and down the
room thinking. The fact that there was a traitor somewhere
among the followers disquieted him profoundly.
And when I had finished he came up to me and said
with intense earnestness: &#8220;You have some definite
purpose in keeping that letter, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. I mean to try and find the writer of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure there is no one you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know all your followers; if there is any
one among them who seeks to prevent my getting&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke in, with an impatient motion of the hand.
&#8220;Do you give me your word you have no positive
suspicion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a question you should expect me to answer?
I am not one of you, and I have no interest whatever in
your cause. If I am anxious to discover the writer,
it is for my own purposes not yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are helping you in trusting that to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it back if you will;&#8221; and I held it out.</p>

<p>He shook his head and did not take it. &#8220;If you
find out the truth you will tell me?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I make no promise. I may or I may not, but
frankly that will turn upon my own concerns, not
upon yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very straight,&#8221; he said, with a slow hesitating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
smile, much more suggestive of vexation than
mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better leave it there. It is not
improbable that if I do get at the truth I may need
your help. In that case I shall come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like something more definite.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;Not yet, at any rate,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may visit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any time you please. And now, I&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>While we had been speaking Maral was taking papers
from the desk, and as he turned and held out his hand to
bid me good-night, we heard the sound of loud knocking
at the door of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can that be?&#8221; he exclaimed nervously.</p>

<p>The next moment the room door was thrust open
and the young fellow who had played the part of informer
rushed in.</p>

<p>&#8220;The police!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;The house is surrounded.
All the rest have gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Barosa did not turn a hair, but Maral, suddenly
grey with fear, tossed up his hands and dropped into
his chair with a sigh of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they really the police this time?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;More of the same man&#8217;s work,&#8221;
he said with grim concentrated passion, and carried
away for the moment by his feelings, he clenched his
fists and uttered a vehement oath.</p>

<p>I should have sworn too, no doubt, if I had been
in his place. But I was thinking of myself and what
I was going to do.</p>

<p>It was a tight corner for us all.</p>

<p>In the pause the knocking was repeated more noisily
and peremptorily than before.</p>

<small>POLICE METHODS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT the second summons Barosa roused himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do, Mr. Donnington. We
have a secret means of leaving the house and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I swear I had forgotten that,&#8221; exclaimed Maral,
as he jumped up, grabbed his papers and made for
the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait please. Give me the letter which M. Volheno
wrote me,&#8221; I said, stopping him.</p>

<p>He searched for it agitatedly and then thrust it
into my hand. &#8220;Come on, Barosa,&#8221; he cried and
darted away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to remain?&#8221; asked Barosa, hurriedly.</p>

<p>I nodded. &#8220;You won&#8217;t want to use this house
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The crash of glass below interrupted him,
announcing that the police had broken in, and the
next moment I had the room to myself and sat
down to wait for the real police and find out how
their treatment differed from that of the bogus
ones.</p>

<p>With Volheno&#8217;s letter in my possession I had nothing
to fear, and I glanced at it to make sure that Maral
in his panic had handed me the right one&mdash;and then
gave a start of surprise.</p>

<p>It was Volheno&#8217;s letter all right, but folded up in
it was a long doubled strip of paper with three rows of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
small holes punched in it at irregular intervals. I knew
instantly what it was&mdash;the key to the cipher which
I had seen attached to the letter which I had duplicated.</p>

<p>As the police might have a fancy to search me I
rolled it and the other strip very tightly, emptied a
cigarette, inserted the roll, and plugged up the ends
with tobacco; and just when the police were at the
door I struck a match and was puffing at the cigarette
as two of them entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, gentlemen, I&#8217;m very relieved to see
you,&#8221; I said, rising and carefully pinching out the
lighted tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are our prisoner,&#8221; exclaimed one of them,
covering me with a revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m extremely relieved to hear it, I can assure
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other scoundrels who use this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my intense satisfaction your arrival scared
them away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try and fool us with that tone. You won&#8217;t
help them and it will make things worse for you. Put
up your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did so, at once, of course, keeping hold of my
precious cigarette, and they made a very business-like
search of all my pockets, and then felt all about
me to see that I had no weapons. They put the results
of their search on the desk, and one of them, being a
very zealous officer, went to the trouble of breaking open
two or three of the cigarettes and pinching and
bending the rest. But it did not occur to him that I
could be smoking one which he might wish to see. It
had been quite a happy thought, that little precaution
of mine.</p>

<p>Then one of them picked up the letter from Volheno
and was unfolding it when I said gently: &#8220;I am not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
sure that M. Volheno will care for you to read correspondence
between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name acted like a charm of magic. He refolded
it and dropped it like a live coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would, however, assist you to understand the
position, my friend, and appreciate your mistake,&#8221;
I said in the same suave tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Ralph Donnington. I am an Englishman
and have the privilege of enjoying the friendship
of M. Volheno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you say who you were before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not ask me, and I never argue with the man
at the butt end of a revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is it you are here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is a matter I can better explain to my
friend, M. Volheno, himself.&#8221; Seeing the excellent
effect of the name, I deemed it judicious to rub it in.
&#8220;Are you in command here? If not, I wish you
would bring your superior here or take me to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They whispered together and one of them left
the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know where you are? What this house
is, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, perfectly. I have had very good proof
of it. Would you have any objection to my lowering
my hands? This is rather a trying position.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded and his face relaxed in a grin which he
turned away to conceal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should also like my matchbox and cigarettes&mdash;if
you don&#8217;t think I shall blow the Government up
with them. Thank you very much,&#8221; I added as he
handed them to me.</p>

<p>Affecting considerable annoyance at the condition
of the cigarettes, I tossed away those which were broken,
and while pretending to straighten out the bent ones
I managed to slip the one I held into the case without
his knowledge. Then I lit another and pocketed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
case, and sat puffing away, with that air of easy
indifference affected by the cigarette-smoking villain
in melodrama when he is top dog and has all the virtuous
members of the caste in his power.</p>

<p>I had nearly finished the cigarette when the man
returned with a superior officer whose look of chagrin
told me that the raid had been unsuccessful and
that Barosa and the rest had escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what is your story?&#8221; he asked brusquely.</p>

<p>As he had the look of a man who would not stand
any nonsense, I dropped my air of indifference. &#8220;I
am an Englishman, Donnington is my name. I quite
understand that my presence here requires explanation
and that of course I am entirely in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your explanation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was brought here by force.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sneered. &#8220;You think I shall believe that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure that my friend, M. Volheno, will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does M. Volheno know of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your men took from me a letter he wrote to me.
It is on the desk there and explains itself. But it is
marked confidential; and whether he would wish you
to read it is a point I will leave to you. I am indifferent.&#8221;</p>

<p>This proved a good card. He stretched out his hand
to take the letter and paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me the purport of it,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. I can&#8217;t do that. It is a confidential
letter, I say. I cannot disclose it therefore. But I
am your prisoner and cannot prevent your doing what
you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>His perplexity was quite amusing.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know it is not a forgery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that myself, but it was addressed
to me at my rooms, 318, Rua de Palma, and reached
me to-night through the post.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long have you been in this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some hours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; he cried with another sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no. For part of the time one man was here;
for others, two; and at times perhaps a dozen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no more idea than you. There were two
of them when you and your men arrived. I was then
left alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the house was surrounded. They couldn&#8217;t
escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was brought straight to this room and have not
been allowed to leave it for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Allowed&#8217;?&#8221; he repeated quickly, catching at
the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I mean. Otherwise, I certainly
should not have remained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were the men?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;I would
tell you if I could.&#8221; This was a deliberate equivocation,
but it saved me from a direct lie. I meant that
I could not because of my pledge, but I meant him
to infer that I did not know.</p>

<p>He paused and I added: &#8220;And now I shall be glad
to know what you propose to do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose we generally do with prisoners?
Billet them at the Avenida Palace Hotel?
You&#8217;ll be locked up for the rest of the night, of course,
while we make inquiries about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman&mdash;as I have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What of that? What&#8217;s good enough for a
Portuguese is good enough for an Englishman, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am also a friend of M. Volheno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you say. But do you expect me to rouse him
in the middle of the night whenever a revolutionary
rascal chooses to say he is a friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can give you the names of several other influential
men who know me. The Marquis de Pinsara,
Visconte de Linto,&#8221; and I rattled off a number of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
men to whom I had been introduced on the night of the
reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can communicate with them in the morning
and call them as witnesses,&#8221; he sneered. He had the
sardonic habit strongly developed. &#8220;But I haven&#8217;t
done questioning you yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not answer any more questions. You
don&#8217;t believe what I tell you. My object was to avoid
the unpleasantness of being thrust into one of your
filthy gaols; and that has evidently failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will tell me where the men are hidden who
were here with you,&#8221; he said very threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat, I know no more than you do. You were
already in the house when they left this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do for me,&#8221; he answered bluntly. He
motioned to the two men who pulled my hands behind
my back and slipped a pair of handcuffs on my wrists,
while he himself sat down at the desk and made a list
of the things the men had taken from me. &#8220;Is this
all?&#8221; he asked the fellow who had searched me.</p>

<p>&#8220;All but a cigarette case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but cigarettes. I made sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221; I breathed more freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, prisoner, show me the secret hiding-place
in this room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is none. The men left the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came close up and glared so fiercely into my face
that I thought he was going to strike me. He was the
sort of brute to enjoy hitting a defenceless man. &#8220;If
you lie to me, I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he ground his teeth and left
me to finish the sentence out of my own fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not lie,&#8221; I said meeting his look steadily.
&#8220;And you will do well to bear in mind in all you do
now that in the morning you will find every word I
have said as to my friendship with M. Volheno is
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke very calmly thinking it would have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
better effect. But it appeared to enrage him and
this time he actually raised his hand for a blow. It
was therefore clearly time to try a change of manner.</p>

<p>So I shoved my head forward until our noses were
nearly touching and with a fierce oath, I cried: &#8220;You
dare to lay a hand on me, you infernal bully, and it
shall cost you dear. M. Volheno shall know of this.
Do your duty whatever that may be, but not one jot
more, or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and I adopted his tactic of an unfinished
sentence.</p>

<p>The result was a surprising success. His hand fell
to his side, his eyes wavered, and his threatening
truculence of manner dropped from him like a cloak.
The reason was, of course, that he was a miserable
coward and had mistaken my coolness for fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only doing my duty,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie,&#8221; I thundered back, quick to take advantage
of his mood. &#8220;You dare to handcuff me like a
felon, when I tell you I am a British subject and give
you ample means of testing what I say. You&#8217;ll have
to reckon with the British Legation for this. Do
what you will, while you have me in your power;
but don&#8217;t think for an instant you won&#8217;t have to pay
for your bullying in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to excuse yourself. If you want to
bully any one, do it with the unfortunate devils under
your orders. As for me, do what you dare&mdash;but
remember, it will be my turn to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll give your word not to offer resistance,
you shall be freed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t ask that before you handcuffed me.
I call these men to witness that. Take me in them
to M. Volheno&mdash;if you dare. Or haul me off to gaol
in them. It&#8217;s all one to me&mdash;until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and then signed to the men who freed
me, and he left the room. I sat down and the men
stood near the door whispering and sniggering together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
They appeared to be rather pleased at their chief&#8217;s
discomfiture.</p>

<p>He was away so long that I fell asleep and was in the
middle of a realistic dream that I was in prison among
the scum of the city when I was roused by some one
thundering my name in my ear.</p>

<p>I started up and found the official had returned
with a companion who was shaking me and calling me
by name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington! Mr. Donnington!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it?&#8221; I grumbled, blinking at him
like an owl until I recognized him as a man I had seen
at Volheno&#8217;s bureau.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Volheno desired me to come to you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho,&#8221; I chuckled, turning to the official, &#8220;so
you thought discretion was the better part of bullying,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Dagara, Mr. Donnington. I am M.
Volheno&#8217;s private secretary. He instructed me to
say that he desires to see you as soon as you can call
on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to go to gaol first,&#8221; I said with a snarl for
my old enemy. &#8220;I was already there in my dreams
when you roused me. But if I am to be shot or hanged
or beheaded as this man decides, I&#8217;ll leave directions
for my corpse to be packed up neatly and sent to M.
Volheno.&#8221; I was winning so I could afford a small
jibe.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are of course at liberty to go where you will,&#8221;
said Dagara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go back to bed,&#8221; I declared as I rose,
&#8220;and will see M. Volheno in the morning. I have
to tell him how this brute has treated me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The official had wilted like an unwatered flower in
the noon sunlight. He returned me my belongings
and began to mumble an apology. &#8220;I much regret&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt of it. I know your kind,&#8221; I cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
in drily, and then left the house with Dagara, feeling
that I was well out of an ugly business.</p>

<p>I had come off with all the honours of war, too, for
my letters had not been read and the two little secret
papers were safely stowed away in my cigarette case.</p>

<p>The secretary walked with me to my rooms and I
found him an exceedingly close-lipped individual.
The house where the drastic test of my good faith had
been applied was in the Rua Formosa, about half a
mile from the Rua de Palma; and during the walk I
could get little else than monosyllables from my companion.
He did go so far as to tell me that he had
been at work all night with Volheno and that that
was the reason he had not gone home and had been
able to come so promptly to identify me.</p>

<p>But when I asked him about the police official he
replied that he knew nothing.</p>

<p>I soon ceased to question him, and as we reached
my rooms, he said suddenly: &#8220;You will understand
of course that M. Volheno never allows me to speak
of any of his affairs. I will give him your message,
and wish you good-morning, Mr. Donnington;&#8221; and
with this abrupt apology in explanation of his silence,
he raised his hat and went off.</p>

<p>A useful and silently working wheel, no doubt, in
the complicated machinery of the Dictator&#8217;s system
of government, was my mental verdict as I entered
my rooms, eager to examine my prizes at leisure.</p>

<p>I put back some of the things Barosa&#8217;s men had
left littered about, brewed myself some strong coffee,
and set to work.</p>

<p>I first read through again very carefully the forged
letter which had been sent to Volheno. That it was
the work of an enemy who was well versed in my
movements was of course on the surface. My friendship
with the man to whom it was addressed, my
secret knowledge of the house in the Rua Catania,
my business in regard to these Beira concessions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
these three points told their story as plainly as the
attempt proved the ingenious malignity of the writer,
and his intention to cause Barosa and his friends to
suspect me of treachery. The blow was aimed at my
life.</p>

<p>There was only one man in all Lisbon who could
have the needed information and would have the
motive.</p>

<p>Sampayo.</p>

<p>Jealousy was one motive, and fear of what I knew
about him another. And he was just the sort of
cunning beast to go to work in this mole-like way. He
had reckoned that Barosa&#8217;s people would accept
without question such a proof of my treachery and
act upon it. And in all probability they would have
done so, but for my conversation with Barosa on
the night of the reception and his conviction of my
good faith.</p>

<p>But there was another point. He must have known
that the contents of the letter would be at once passed
on to Barosa. There was therefore some one about
Volheno in league with the revolutionary party,
and that some one must be sufficiently high in his
confidence to be able to get the letter and send it to
his friends.</p>

<p>I must find that man out; and then I studied the
little slip of paper which Maral had inadvertently
given me with the letter.</p>

<p>The line of nonsense ran as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Real effects to you truly. You know what this
only can mean. 134&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Absolute gibberish of course. But I had the key.</p>

<p>I noticed that the sentence exactly fitted a line of
the same length as the strip of paper with the holes in
it; and when I laid the first line of holes on the top
of the words the meaning was clear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>All the letters were covered by it except the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>RETURN AT ONCE</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Return at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>A simple direction to send the letter back; and 134
was probably the number by which the man was
known to his companions. I had had my trouble for
nothing&mdash;or next to nothing; for the cipher key did
not cover the figures at the end of the message.</p>

<p>Then a thought struck me. The numerals might
stand for letters: 134 would be &#8220;A. C. D.;&#8221; or 13
and 4, &#8220;M.D.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M.D.!&#8221; I uttered the letters aloud in my surprise.
They were Miralda&#8217;s initials. &#8220;Miralda Dominguez.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coincidence mazed me; but a moment&#8217;s reflection
made the inference appear grotesque, preposterous,
idiotic; and I laughed at it.</p>

<p>But my nerves were out of balance. The ordeal
of the last few hours, following so close upon the tense
interview with Miralda on the <i>Stella</i>, had tried me
severely. Everybody appeared to be playing at
make-believe to cause me to misread everything I saw
and heard.</p>

<p>Even as I laughed at the thought that Miralda could
have had even the remotest connexion with the
cipher message, the disconcerting possibility suggested
by the coincidence would not be shaken off.</p>

<p>Furious with myself, for the subconscious distrust
of her which this depression of spirits implied, I huddled
the papers together and went off to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE REAL &#8220;M. D.&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW hours&#8217; sleep enabled me to laugh much
more sincerely at the thought which had sent
me off to bed in a hurry, and I was reviewing the
whole situation when Miralda&#8217;s brother called. He
had the look of a man who had been making a night
of it, and was washed out and generally sorry for himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo, then, I have caught you, Mr. Donnington.
May I come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you may,&#8221; I said as I shook hands with
him, put him into an easy chair and handed him the
cigarettes. &#8220;Why, did you think you wouldn&#8217;t catch
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette and I saw that his hand shook
badly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Oh, you&#8217;re such a busy man, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
His hesitancy and a note in his voice suggested nervousness,
as if he had been momentarily at a loss
how to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not too busy for a chat with you at any time,
lieutenant.&#8221; I spoke cordially because I wished to
be friendly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; he said, adding after a puff or two:
&#8220;You look confoundedly fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much the matter, I&#8217;m glad to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should think not, indeed.&#8221; Another pause
followed and he put his eyeglass in position, glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
at me and then round the room, and let it fall again.
&#8220;I suppose not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you have a pick-me-up?&#8221; I asked. It struck
me he had been looking about for one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cognac,&#8221; he replied with a nod. I rang for my
servant, Bryant, and mixed a brandy and soda, which
Vasco drank eagerly. &#8220;Had a hot night of it,&#8221; he
murmured with one of his inane grins as he set the
empty glass down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always do, curse the luck,&#8221; he answered, and
pouring himself out about a wine-glassful of brandy
he gulped it down. &#8220;Hair of the dog, you know,&#8221;
he added, smacking his lips. The spirit stimulated
him. &#8220;Better luck next time;&#8221; and he laughed, the
frown left his face, and he lolled back smoking with
an air of indifference real or assumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re off, eh? Going in your yacht?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Off? Where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home, I suppose. That&#8217;s what I meant about
catching you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not? Why Sampayo&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he stopped suddenly.
&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t Sampayo of course&mdash;but I heard you
were going last night,&#8221; he said, evidently confused
by his first slip.</p>

<p>My interest awoke in an instant. If Sampayo had
sent him to me, it was probably to learn the issue of
the previous night&#8217;s scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;No no. I shan&#8217;t be able to get away for a long
time to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I wonder why the deuce&mdash;I&#8217;m awfully glad
to hear it. Then you won&#8217;t be taking your boat away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. But I&#8217;m afraid the weather yesterday
made your trip in her rather unpleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. The fact is I&mdash;I came to ask you
a favour. I wonder if you&#8217;d mind lending her to me
for a day. As a matter of fact I want to give some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
of the fellows of my regiment a bit of an outing, and
I should like to take &#8217;em out in her.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said all this with the air of one repeating a lesson
and very much afraid of forgetting it. &#8220;My dear
lieutenant, you can have her and welcome. Give me
a couple of days&#8217; notice, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll think it cool of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not cool of <i>you</i> at all; but I think Major Sampayo
himself might have asked, instead of worrying you to
do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat bolt upright and stared at me. &#8220;I say, how
the deuce did you know?&#8221; he cried, astonishment
shaking all the pretence out of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that. You can have the <i>Stella</i>,&#8221; I
answered, with a smile, intending him to infer that I
knew much more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m a clumsy sort of ass. I suppose I
gave it away. Dashed if you don&#8217;t beat me;&#8221; and
he shook his head in perplexity as he first tried to
relight his cigarette and then threw it away and started
a fresh one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Major Sampayo tell you why he thought I was
leaving in such a hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, hold on. I&#8217;m getting a bit afraid of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the last man in Lisbon you need be afraid
of, lieutenant. I have the greatest desire for your
friendship and&mdash;if you would like to give it&mdash;your
confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spoke earnestly and he glanced at me with a
hunted, harassed look in his eyes, and then reached
for the brandy again. I put it out of his reach. &#8220;I
never was more serious in my life,&#8221; I added. &#8220;If
I can ever help you, you have only to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up. He was pale and shaking. &#8220;I think
I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. But don&#8217;t forget what I&#8217;ve said.
I mean it, on my honour;&#8221; and I held out my hand.</p>

<p>Instead of taking it he looked intently into my eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
and then, to my surprise, and pain, he seemed to crumple
up suddenly. He threw himself back into the chair,
covered his face with his hands and burst into tears.</p>

<p>It is hateful to see a man cry, but the feeling I had
for him was rather pity than contempt. His tears
told me so much. He was the merest tool in Sampayo&#8217;s
hands, and his weak nature was as clay for the stronger
man&#8217;s moulding. Miralda&#8217;s words flashed across my
mind&mdash;that behind her betrothal to Sampayo was a
&#8220;story of shame and crime.&#8221; Here was the key to it,
I was convinced.</p>

<p>The shock of learning that I knew Sampayo was in
the background, his fear of what I knew, followed by
my earnest offer of friendship, confidence and help,
coming at a moment when he was shaken by a night
of dissipation, had unmanned him.</p>

<p>With an excuse that I had to speak to Bryant, I
left him alone for a few minutes, and when I returned
he was staring out of the window smoking.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think me an awful fool and baby, Mr.
Donnington,&#8221; he said nervously and shamefacedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Any man might break down under the load
you are carrying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come and see you again? I&#8217;m all shaken
up now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do better than that. Tell me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you read a fellow&#8217;s thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and tell me frankly what hold Major
Sampayo has on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; he repeated, in the same
hesitating way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t preach. I only wish to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you. I&mdash;I daren&#8217;t. I wish to
heaven I dared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean because of&mdash;your sister and all the
others involved?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>With a quick start he asked, &#8220;Is it on her account
you ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is on your account, I ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wavered, but with a shrug of his thin shoulders
he turned back to stare out of the window again. After
a pause he said somewhat irritably. &#8220;I&#8217;m not in the
confessional box, Mr. Donnington. You&#8217;ve no right to
question me. And after all, you can&#8217;t help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think that, there&#8217;s an end of the thing,
lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve put your back up, I suppose?&#8221; and
he laughed feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least, I assure you. I know that you
are in a devil of a mess&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know it? Has Miralda&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention your sister&#8217;s name, please,&#8221; I
interposed in my turn, speaking sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sampayo says you hate him on her account.
And he hates you. There&#8217;s no mistake about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet he sent you to borrow my yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s for another thing altogether&mdash;there I go.
If I stop here you&#8217;ll have everything out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean in regard to this wretched conspiracy,
I probably know much more than you could tell
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His jaw fell in his surprise. &#8220;You know and yet
lend the <i>Stella</i>? Why, are you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused
and stared at me in gaping bewilderment.</p>

<p>There could be only one reason for this. The <i>Stella</i>
was to be used for some purpose connected with the
revolutionaries and he had jumped to the conclusion
that I was in league with them. Before I could reply
he saw his mistake. &#8220;What a mess I&#8217;m making of
things,&#8221; he muttered to himself; and then to me
weakly&mdash;&#8220;Don&#8217;t question me any more, Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. But I was not asking you about that
at all, merely your personal affairs.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>He stood glancing at me nervously and irresolutely.
&#8220;I say, you won&#8217;t give me away, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my word on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even to Miralda, I mean? I told her I wanted
to talk to you, but she wouldn&#8217;t hear of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of days ago.&#8221; That was before our talk
on the <i>Stella</i> when she had been intent upon keeping
me at a distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you ask her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you go again. You said you wouldn&#8217;t
question me. I wish you wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said peevishly,
and then added with utter inconsequence; &#8220;she used
to be always speaking of you when she came back
from Paris. You were Miralda&#8217;s Englishman, you
know. And when you turned up here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you didn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an odd mixture. One minute you want
to know everything and the next you shut me up.
She&#8217;s awfully white and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s so hard on
her that I feel such a brute. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he pulled up
suddenly and seized his hat. &#8220;No, hang it, I can&#8217;t
tell you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Bryant brought in a letter from
Volheno asking me to go to him at once, and when
we were alone again Vasco held out his hand. &#8220;May
I come again? I&mdash;I <i>should</i> like to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him to come any time, and having made me
repeat my promise not to give him away, he wrung
my hand and went off.</p>

<p>So Miralda was being sacrificed to save her brother
from the consequences of the &#8220;shame and crime&#8221;
of which he had been guilty. That was unmistakably
plain now; as plain as that Sampayo was the
brute who was demanding the sacrifice as the price
of his silence.</p>

<p>In one way it was good news to me. I had feared
that there might prove to be some other obstacle far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
more difficult to overcome. But the instant I sent
Sampayo flying for life from the vengeance of the
Corsican, Prelot, this barrier would cease to have terrors
for either Miralda or her weak-kneed brother. It
would be best, however, to learn what this crime was
before dealing with Sampayo.</p>

<p>It must be serious, for Vasco was absolutely helpless;
so much so that Miralda had forbidden him to
speak to me. But that must have been before our
explanation on the <i>Stella</i>. Would she still forbid
him?</p>

<p>Other points in the interview were by no means so
clear as the evidence of Sampayo&#8217;s power. Why had
he been sent to me? Was it merely to ascertain whether
I had escaped the snare laid on the previous night?
If so why the request about the <i>Stella</i>?</p>

<p>The two things appeared to be inconsistent, and
yet there was a possible explanation. Knowing
Vasco to be a fool, Sampayo had had to prompt him
with a reason for the call, supposing I had escaped from
the toils. Vasco was prepared to find me gone. He
had blurted that out; and Sampayo had probably
coached him with the request for the yacht to conceal
his own hope&mdash;that I was dead&mdash;and at the same time
to give him something to talk about if I were found
at home.</p>

<p>Could that request for the yacht be genuine? If
so, for what purpose was it wanted? I could not
answer that riddle at present, but I might be able to
get the answer from Vasco.</p>

<p>As I was leaving to go to Volheno, I remembered
the ease with which Barosa&#8217;s men had got into the
flat, so I told Bryant to get a new lock and a bolt
and have them fitted that day. I had had enough of
midnight visitors.</p>

<p>Volheno received me as courteously as ever, but
I soon found that he was profoundly perplexed about
my conduct.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;I expected you much earlier, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry. I didn&#8217;t get to bed till six o&#8217;clock and
lay late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll understand that I have been anxious to
hear your news. You have rendered me a most valuable
service by giving me the information about that
Rua Catania house, and you will add immensely to
my obligation if you&#8217;ll tell me about this affair last
night in the Rua Formosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not rendered you any service at all, as a
matter of fact. I was coming to see you about your
letter. It was a complete puzzle. I did not write
to you at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I altogether. But if you received a
letter signed with my name giving information, it was
a forgery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington! Are you serious?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never more sober in my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rang his table bell. &#8220;Tell M. Dagara to come to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is out, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to come to me the instant he returns. I
had no doubt that the signature was yours. I couldn&#8217;t
doubt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must doubt it now. I declare to you
positively that I did not write the letter which put you
on the track of that Rua Catania business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bound to say I thought it strange that, having
been only a few hours in the city, you should have
got secret information which my people have been
trying in vain to get for weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>I let this go without a reply, but he guessed my
reason for silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had you any such information in your possession?&#8221;
he asked, shooting a quick questioning glance
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I would rather not answer that question.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;That means that you had, of course, and makes
the matter all the stranger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll admit I knew something,&#8221; I said on
second thoughts, reflecting that I should have to
explain the previous night&#8217;s affair. &#8220;These are the
facts. You remember warning me not to be in the
streets at night. I disregarded the warning and on
the second night I got into the middle of a fight between
the mob and the police, and had to run for it.
By chance I found shelter in that house in the Rua
Catania and afterwards learnt the character of the
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw some of these villains there, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and had a bit of trouble, but I got out all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, after considering. &#8220;But the position
is this. I only got away by passing my word of honour
not to speak of anything or any person I had seen
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course such a pledge given under those circumstances
is not to be considered binding. Do you know
the names of any of them or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;I must keep the word I gave,
M. Volheno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you keep your word to a murderer who
spared your life on condition that you kept secret a
murder you had seen him commit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That case has not arisen and I would prefer not
to discuss questions of casuistry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But these men are assassins and worse. They
are enemies of the State ripe for any evil work. I must
press you to tell me all you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lips are sealed. And to that fact I owe my
escape from worse trouble last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell me that then,&#8221; he said, with a deep
frown of vexation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;The letter you received in my name was really intended
to fix on me a charge of having broken my
pledge;&#8221; and I went on to give him a short and carefully
worded account of what had passed, laying
particular stress upon my treatment by the police.</p>

<p>He put the last point aside with a short promise
that the matter should be sifted, and then questioned
me at great length and with all the pressure he
could exert to get me to give the names of the men
I had seen, or a description of them.</p>

<p>I resisted all his pressure and then he tried argument.
He explained the position of the Government,
and their difficulties; the urgent necessity that they
should know who were their friends and who their
enemies, declaring that my information might be of
positively vital importance.</p>

<p>In reply I uttered one or two home truths, telling
him that in my opinion they were trying their hands
at repression in a very amateurish fashion; employing
enough force to render many classes of the people dissatisfied
and violent, but not enough to keep them
in subjection.</p>

<p>We were hammering away at this when Dagara
entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked for me, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Bring me the file of personal letters&mdash;A
to F. That brings us back from the general
question to your part in particular, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said, when the secretary had gone out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not press me any more. I cannot do
what you ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did press me very strongly indeed, and
then Dagara returned with the file of letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want that which Mr. Donnington wrote about
the Rua Catania affair. Just find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was not a little curious to see whether the copy
I had made had been returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I left it in my desk,&#8221; said Dagara.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Oh, how many times have I told you to file these
at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did file it, sir, but if you remember you asked
for it when you were dictating the reply to Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manoel, Manoel, is that any excuse for not refiling
it at once?&#8221; exclaimed Volheno, and proceeded to
lecture the man for his carelessness.</p>

<p>It was well for me that both of them were thus
engaged, and I rose and strolled to the window and
looked out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Manoel,&#8221; was his first name, then, &#8220;Manoel
Dagara&#8221;; and in a flash the identity of the &#8220;M. D.&#8221;
of the cipher message was plain.</p>

<p>This sleek, secretive, smooth-tongued secretary who
had parried my questions with the unctuous plea
that his employer enjoined such close silence in regard
to his affairs, was in league with Barosa! On such
terms indeed that he even purloined private letters
and carried them to his other masters.</p>

<p>Here in the very eye of the web of Government
was a traitor.</p>

<p>Volheno might well say they did not know who were
friends and who enemies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>MIRALDA&#8217;S CONFIDENCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the door closed behind Dagara I returned to
my seat. M. Volheno was obviously annoyed
by the incident, but I observed that it was rather the
fact of the secretary&#8217;s negligence than the consequences
of it which had ruffled his temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would scarcely believe, judging by this, the
trouble I have taken to train that young man. Since
his marriage there has been some difference in him;
but he is usually as dependable as a machine, and
does his work with precision, speed and silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man of the kind is, of course, essential for such
confidential affairs as yours,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I can trust him. He has my entire
confidence and is a perfect encyclop&aelig;dia of details.
As a matter of fact he is a distant connexion of mine,
an orphan, and I educated him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a man has reason to be grateful,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he would give his life for me,&#8221; declared
Volheno confidently.</p>

<p>Dagara came back then, but without the letter, and
I concluded that Maral had failed to send him the copy
I had made. While he was making his explanation I
observed him very carefully.</p>

<p>He was genuinely troubled, as he might well be,
indeed; but there was so little in his look and manner
suggestive of roguery or hypocrisy that, despite what
I knew, I set him down as an honest fellow who had
been forced against his will into this treachery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>His explanation was that the letter was probably
among his employer&#8217;s papers and that he would make
a search for it; and Volheno, trusting him implicitly,
accepted the story and sent him away with another
word or two of censure.</p>

<p>Then he resumed his efforts to get me to disclose
what I knew, but adopted a different line. He referred
to the concessions, and gave me to understand
that, whereas it would help me in regard to them if I
told him things, my refusal would as certainly prejudice
my chances.</p>

<p>I did not attach the value of a rotten orange to them,
but I deemed it judicious to make a fine display of
rather indignant surprise.</p>

<p>From that he went a step further&mdash;that although he
himself had no doubt that I had acquired the information
innocently, it was highly probable that those to
whom he was bound to report the matter would not
take the same view; and he hinted that in such a case
I might receive a request to leave the country.</p>

<p>That touched me on the raw, but I instantly professed
a readiness to leave. I would go that very day
if he wished, but in such a case, of course, the concessions
would be dropped and there would be no plums
in the future for those who looked for them in return
for help at the present.</p>

<p>And then he grew a little more subtle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another point, Mr. Donnington. We
shall necessarily take more interest than heretofore
in your movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite indifferent about that,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;You may quarter your agents in my rooms and on my
yacht, if you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean any such thing as you imply. But
you have certain friends in Lisbon, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On your introduction,&#8221; I reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, for instance, the Visconte de
Linto.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;To whom I was presented by the Marquis de Pinsara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some of his family were known to you previously.
The whole of that family occupy a somewhat peculiar
position. You may have heard that the visconte filled
for some years a Court position with a good emolument
and no duties. M. Franco has put an end to
that&mdash;as in so many other cases&mdash;and this has produced
both discontent and bitterness in some quarters.
Between such discontent and actual disaffection,
the gap is small; and we cannot help being impressed
by a coincidence where we find close friendly relations
between some such family and a foreigner who suddenly
acquires such dangerous information as you
yourself possess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you mean that my acquaintance is likely to
prejudice them in any way, it shall cease. But it is a
mare&#8217;s nest&mdash;nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The prejudice might be against you, Mr. Donnington.
The position of that family is&mdash;peculiar.
The visconte is angry and embittered by the loss of
his salary. His wife is indiscreet and has often spoken
against the Government in very strong terms. The
son is a lieutenant in the one regiment in Lisbon some
of whose officers are not wholly free from a suspicion
of disaffection. And the daughter, a very charming
young lady, is engaged to marry another officer of the
same regiment and, further, has one or two friends&mdash;one
especially&mdash;who is something of an enigma. Then
you arrive, and&mdash;well, you can draw the inference.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;The inference I draw, M. Volheno, is
not from surmise but from a knowledge of facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t you think you would be well advised
to let me have in confidence the information you have
gained?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already explained&mdash;I am bound by my
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can do no good by further discussion,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
he exclaimed abruptly, and rose to end the interview.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment whether to tell him that I had
really come to Lisbon on Miralda&#8217;s account, but
thought it better to hold my tongue. It would have
shown him the strength of his threat to pack me out
of the country.</p>

<p>The interview left me with the extremely unpleasant
and disquieting feeling that I was getting out of my
depth in troubled waters which might easily be lashed
into a storm.</p>

<p>Why he had introduced the topic of the de Linto
family, I could not understand. Yet he must have
had a reason, and I ought to know it. Could I get
it from Dagara? He had Volheno&#8217;s confidence, and
if Barosa and his associates could force him to give
them information, I might be able to squeeze him also
under a threat of exposure. The plan was infinitely
distasteful; but if Miralda&#8217;s safety was at stake, I
was ready to adopt almost any means to protect
her.</p>

<p>She was in some danger, clearly. She had told me
herself that, although she was no rebel, she was compromised.
And as Volheno suspected her, it might
be only a short time before discovery would follow
and suspicion materialize into an actual charge.</p>

<p>Considerably alarmed at this prospect I decided to
come to close grips with Sampayo at once. He might
not be the only obstacle between Miralda and me, but
the situation would certainly be much clearer the
instant he was out of the way.</p>

<p>I went off in search of him that afternoon, therefore,
but learnt that he was in Oporto and would not return
until the following day. On my way back I met the
Visconte de Linto close to his house and he urged me to
go in with them. He was eager to know something
more about the concessions and his own prospects
in regard to them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>This proved to be a preface to a long account of
his grievances against the Dictator. I was a very
patient, sympathetic listener; and my patience was
rewarded, for I succeeded in steering the talk round to
the subject of Sampayo, about whom I wished to know
the visconte&#8217;s real opinion. I appealed to his cupidity,
therefore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should very much value your advice on a point
concerning Major Sampayo,&#8221; I said in a confidence-inviting
tone. &#8220;I am told that his influence with the
Government is so great that his help alone would be
enough to secure me all I want. Of course you&#8217;ll
see my difficulty. I should be delighted to have my
friends sharing in the good things; but those behind
me naturally expect me to limit the number. Now,
if he can do everything, of course he is just the man
for their purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face fell. &#8220;He couldn&#8217;t do that, Mr. Donnington.
Of course, he is a <i>wealthy</i> man and all that, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and he shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely wealthy&mdash;in our sense of the word, visconte,&#8221;
I replied airily. &#8220;Not wealthy compared with men who
are prepared to put fifty or a hundred thousand
pounds into a single scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will your friends go that extent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the concessions are such as I desire, I should be
ready to do much more than that myself.&#8221; I spoke
intentionally as if such a sum were a mere bagatelle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be a very wealthy man, then, Mr.
Donnington,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I smiled blandly and shrugged my shoulders, and
then became very earnest. &#8220;I could of course finance
the whole thing myself; and if I could find some one
here in Lisbon to co-operate with me honourably and
straightforwardly&mdash;he must of course be a man of
the highest honour&mdash;I might do so; and should of
course leave all the negotiations here to him. Well,
the question is then whether Major Sampayo is such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
a man. I place great reliance upon your opinion,
as he is to marry your daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>His perplexity at this was almost comical. He saw
that his own chance of plunder was in danger, and
did not know how to save it without running down the
man who was to marry Miralda.</p>

<p>&#8220;You place me in a great difficulty, sir,&#8221; he said
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you something in confidence, then.
I do not like Major Sampayo. Of course in business
matters we do not allow such personal considerations
to determine our actions, although they may influence
us. I would much rather work with such a man as
yourself for instance. But as his name is known to
those behind me, of course any decision I may make
and my reason for it might reach him.&#8221;</p>

<p>His alarm at this was obvious. &#8220;I&mdash;I am afraid
I cannot say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course as your son-in-law, his success would
benefit you. An indirect benefit, perhaps, but still
a benefit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our conversation has taken a very unexpected
turn, Mr. Donnington. I was under the impression
you desired my influence in any event.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be a question between yours or his,&#8221; I
said, pressing him further into the corner. &#8220;That is
why I have spoken as I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I really cannot say anything. You must decide
for yourself. I should be delighted to be associated
with you, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he shook his head and paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are afraid of Sampayo?&#8221; I finished for
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington!&#8221; he exclaimed with no little
indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take offence, please, at least until you have
heard me out. Will you give me your word of honour
not to speak of what I wish to tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;In coming to Lisbon I had another object besides
these concessions. I met your daughter in Paris, and
my disappointment was intense when I found that she
was betrothed to Major Sampayo. I had hoped that
in all my affairs I should have enjoyed the advantage
of your help&mdash;as that of a relative by marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tossed up his hands and stared at me in speechless
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I have been here&mdash;you must pardon my
speaking very freely&mdash;it has come to my knowledge
that Sampayo has forced himself upon you by reason
of his knowledge of certain matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Mr. Donnington&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He could get no
further, and jumped up from his chair and began to
pace the room in extreme agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My reason for speaking in this way is to ask you
one very vital question. If Major Sampayo were to relinquish
his claims to your daughter&#8217;s hand, would
you be willing to honour me by allowing me to plead
my own cause with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be only too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he cried impulsively
but checked himself in the middle of the sentence, and
shook his head again. &#8220;It is out of the question; out
of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am answered, on the one point. Now, will you
go a step further and tell me why you deem it out of
the question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really cannot discuss the matter. I really cannot,&#8221;
he said nervously. &#8220;You must excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot press you, of course. But will you think
it over and let me see you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I must say it would be quite useless,
Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the position may have changed when we
next meet,&#8221; I said as I rose. &#8220;And now, will you
let me give you a hint on another matter. M. Volheno
is my friend, as you know, and when I was with him
to-day I learnt that your attitude toward the Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
is a subject of close and watchful interest. You
and all in this house will be well advised to be on your
guard;&#8221; and without giving him time for the alarm in
his eyes to crystallize into questions, I left him.</p>

<p>As I crossed the hall his wife met me. She greeted
me very warmly and taking me to the saloon asked
me to wait a moment for her.</p>

<p>Before she returned, however, Miralda and Inez
came in. Both were surprised to find me there, and
judging by their manner, their surprise was not so great
as their displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still in Lisbon, Mr. Donnington?&#8221; said
Inez coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously. Does that surprise you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More than I can express. Doesn&#8217;t it, Miralda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; murmured Miralda who was very
much disturbed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no intention of leaving, madame,&#8221; I said
to Inez.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt your correspondence detains you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My correspondence?&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;And your close association with M. Volheno and
the Government.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez!&#8221; exclaimed Miralda, under her breath.</p>

<p>I understood then. They had heard part of the
Rua Catania business, but not the sequel; and Inez
had been using it to poison Miralda against me. I was
not unwilling to see the result. &#8220;It is well known that
M. Volheno is friendly toward me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been an exchange of letters between
you, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, scarcely. He wrote to me and I have written
to him.&#8221; Miralda started uneasily, looked across
quickly, and then dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen your letter to him and have been
speaking to Miralda about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will permit me to doubt that you have seen
the letter I wrote?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;I have a copy of it;&#8221; and she handed it to me.
&#8220;You do not deny that that is what you wrote.&#8221;</p>

<p>I glanced over it. It was in her own handwriting.
&#8220;Word for word, as nearly as I can recollect,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Inez smiled derisively in triumph. &#8220;That is how an
Englishman keeps his word,&#8221; she sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept my word just as an Englishman would,
madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miralda was both perplexed and troubled. &#8220;Do
you really mean you wrote such a letter, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a fact that I wrote a letter addressed to M.
Volheno and couched in those identical terms. Under
the circumstances it was the best course for me to
adopt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miralda caught her breath and winced as if I had
struck her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Circumstances,&#8221; echoed Inez, with a fine scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you had pledged your honour not to reveal a
word of this,&#8221; said Miralda, hesitatingly. &#8220;You
cannot mean that you broke it deliberately in this
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is perfectly plain,&#8221; declared Inez. &#8220;It is
only what I told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miralda shook her head and laid her hand on
Inez&#8217; arm, as she appealed to me. &#8220;Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know enough of us English, mademoiselle,
to judge whether, having given my word, I should
break it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no doubt,&#8221; said Inez, with a contemptuous
toss of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You at least have condemned me. And you,
mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you admit you broke your word, I should be
forced to believe you; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and she threw up her
hands with a frown of perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have not admitted it,&#8221; I said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>&#8220;How can you say that in the face of this letter?&#8221;
cried Inez, her fingers shaking with anger as she held
it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, Inez. You can explain this, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot explain anything&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, what did I say?&#8221; interposed Inez, with
contemptuous scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;To those who have already condemned me without
explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miralda looked at me steadily. &#8220;I have not condemned
you,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I tell you at once that the letter I wrote was
written with the full sanction of a man whose approval
even the Contesse Inglesia will regard as important&mdash;Dr.
Barosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Barosa!&#8221; they exclaimed together, but in very
different accents. Miralda&#8217;s betokened surprise, Inez&#8217;
scorn and disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was written last night in his presence, long after
the raid on the Rua Catania house and when he had
thoroughly satisfied himself and others that I had not
broken my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find that very difficult of belief,&#8221; cried Inez.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez! How dare you?&#8221; cried Miralda impetuously,
and then winced and flushed slightly in some
confusion, as her friend turned sharply upon her with
a meaning glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington is to be congratulated upon having
so zealous a champion,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>

<p>But it was I, not she, who profited by this shaft.
Miralda&#8217;s face set and her eyes shone as she held out
her hand to me. &#8220;I owe you an apology, Mr. Donnington,
for having stooped to listen to this slander. You
have my word for it that I will not do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I took her hand, Inez coughed suggestively.</p>

<p>Miralda understood and turned quickly from me.
&#8220;There is a limit to what I will endure even from you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Inez. You have reached it now;&#8221; and Inez, being a
person of discretion, held her tongue.</p>

<p>I left them, asking Miralda to make my excuses to
her mother, and returned to my rooms in a glow of
pleasure at the proof of Miralda&#8217;s confidence in me, and
her zeal in risking even a breach with Inez on my
account.</p>

<p>At my rooms I found a letter marked &#8220;Urgent and
confidential.&#8221;</p>

<p>I guessed of course that it had some concern with the
concessions, and after puzzling over the unknown
handwriting, as one will at times, I opened it without
much interest.</p>

<p>But I read it with the closest concern. It was from
Vasco, and it gave me the very facts I was so eager to
learn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>ALONE WITH SAMPAYO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">VASCO&#8217;S letter was very long, and so rambling and
inconsequent in parts as to be almost incoherent.
It was obviously written under the impulse of intense
feeling, despair indeed; and was in response to my
solicitation of confidence and offer of help.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe you can help me even if you would,
and I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll care to try when you know
the mess I am in. But you said you would, and a
drowning man catches at straws. I am at the end of
things; utterly broken up and ruined; and bar writing
to you I have only two alternatives&mdash;to shoot
myself or get more hopelessly into the power of the
man who has done a lot to drag me down. That&#8217;s
the mood in which I write to you, and the reason I
write. If you won&#8217;t or can&#8217;t help me, say so at once.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>That was the preface to his ugly story.</p>

<p>Put in a few words he was hopelessly in Sampayo&#8217;s
power. He was a gambler and a hard drinker, and
Sampayo had used both these weaknesses to ruin him.
And ruin him he certainly had, using a craft and cunning
worthy of the man.</p>

<p>Having got Vasco hopelessly in debt to him and
others, Sampayo had succeeded in having him placed
in a position where he had charge of a considerable
sum of money subscribed by the officers of the regiment.
He had then dunned him for payment and set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
others to do the same, and Vasco had been weak enough
to use this money. Sampayo was of course on the
watch, and had discovered the theft within a few
hours of its commission.</p>

<p>To frighten such a weakling was easy work; and
Sampayo had at once engineered matters so that the
money had to be instantly forthcoming. Scared out
of his wits, Vasco had admitted his act, and the scoundrel,
in the guise of friendship, had offered to find the
sum on condition that Vasco gave him a written
confession.</p>

<p>Glad to escape on any terms, Vasco had only too
readily agreed, and exposure had thus been averted.
This was some six months previously. For two of
them Sampayo showed nothing but friendship. Then
the persecution started. Vasco was drawn into the
revolutionary net and forced to commit himself. The
next step was that Miralda should be involved. To
save Vasco she had yielded; and after another interval
the demand that she should consent to marry
Sampayo had followed.</p>

<p>She had resisted this strenuously&mdash;she had been
home from Paris only about a month at the time;
but the utmost pressure had been brought to bear
upon her, not only by the visconte and Vasco, but by
Barosa and the leaders of the revolutionary party.</p>

<p>For two months she had held out, and had yielded
only a month before my arrival.</p>

<p>How this part of the letter stirred me will be readily
understood. After my talk with Miralda on the <i>Stella</i>,
it was not mere coxcombry on my part to believe
that, had I come only a month earlier, I should have
found her ready to receive me on the same footing as
in those weeks in Paris.</p>

<p>I could understand now the reason for Inez&#8217; warning,
Barosa&#8217;s references, Sampayo&#8217;s instant jealousy, and
that regret of the viscontesse that I had not come
sooner. They had known the reason for Miralda&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
stubborn resistance, and had feared that my arrival
would lead to her rebellion.</p>

<p>Vasco&#8217;s immediate request was that I would lend him
some money&mdash;about five hundred pounds&mdash;but he
freely admitted that even if I consented, the money
would not free him from Sampayo.</p>

<p>I sent him a note at once that I would do what he
wanted and would have the money ready for him if he
would come to me the following evening.</p>

<p>But I made it a condition that he should go on board
the <i>Stella</i> at once and remain there until the time for
our interview. I did not mean to give Sampayo a
chance of frightening him into admitting he had told
me. I told Bryant to put the letter into Vasco&#8217;s own
hands and to go with him to the yacht, and I wrote a
line to my skipper with instructions.</p>

<p>It proved to be a prudent precaution. Sampayo
returned about midday and as I found out afterwards
went everywhere in search of Vasco, before going to
his own quarters, where I was waiting.</p>

<p>He had learnt meanwhile that his attempt against
me had failed, but he was genuinely surprised to see
me when he entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of the unexpectedness,&#8221; I replied drily,
taking no notice of the offer of his hand.</p>

<p>He drew himself up stiffly. &#8220;Am I to understand
that your refusal of my hand is intentional?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to understand on my side that you made the
offer of it from any feeling of friendship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very extraordinary question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not altogether an ordinary visit, Major Sampayo.
It has more to do with business of a sort than
friendship. I am right in thinking you do not feel very
well disposed to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really I have no time just now for talk of that
kind. I have been away from the city and have a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
press of matters to attend to. Be good enough to
state your business briefly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He said this in a very curt sharp tone and he crossed
to a writing desk, unlocked it and began to turn over
some papers.</p>

<p>I made no reply, but leant back in my chair and
lighted a cigar. My silence worried him. He kept
up a pretence of being very busy, opening a letter
or two and making some notes as if ignoring my
presence.</p>

<p>Then under the pretence of fetching a book, he rose
and assumed surprise to find me still in the room.
&#8220;Oh, are you still here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, still here, as you see&mdash;waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conduct is very extraordinary. You are
trying my courtesy to the utmost limit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I am only waiting until you have
time and inclination to give me undivided attention.
By all means finish these pressing matters first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, state your business at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may take some time,&#8221; I said with an apologetic
smile. I could not resist the pleasure of playing with
him a little, as a punishment for his conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it has anything to do with the concessions you
are after, you may spare me and yourself the waste
of time in discussing them. I have decided to have
nothing to do with the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I could persuade you to change
your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. The Marquis de Pinsara spoke to
me to endeavour to obtain my influence for you, but I
declined. I will not be mixed up in an affair which
I do not consider quite clean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you there is nothing in it which would
soil your hands, Major Sampayo,&#8221; I said, with just
sufficient emphasis on the &#8220;your&#8221; to rouse him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I consider that remark extremely offensive, sir,&#8221;
he replied hotly. &#8220;And you will be good enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
understand that I do not allow any man, Englishman
or not, to make offensive remarks to me. I do not
suppose you have come to insult me deliberately.&#8221;</p>

<p>His manner was very hectoring; and as it is sometimes
amusing to allow a bully to believe he can bully
you, I allowed him to enjoy this belief for a while.</p>

<p>With a start of affected nervousness I exclaimed
quickly, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure&mdash;I trust&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; as if beginning
an apology, and then stopped and lowered my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be good enough to be more guarded in what
you say and how you say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated as if much impressed and rather cowed
by this and at a loss what to say. &#8220;These concessions,
of course....&#8221; I stammered when he broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my answer in regard to them. It is
final. And now I must ask you to leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put in a little comedy stroke, by tossing up my
hands, glancing half-appealingly at him, and giving
a little sigh of regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do no good by remaining, Mr. Donnington.
You asked me just now whether I had offered you my
hand in any spirit of friendliness. I will tell you now,
I did not. I have no wish for your friendship or your
acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you expressed a desire that we should meet
again and I&mdash;I made quite sure&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I broke off
again and let the sentence falter out in an indistinct
murmur.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know my decision now at any rate. You
understand our language quite well enough for my
meaning to be perfectly plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at his attitude. He appeared
to have quite reassured himself that we had not met
before and that he had nothing to fear from me. And
yet he had set that trap to get me into trouble. I
could only conclude therefore that my present apparent
fear of him led him to think he could safely intimidate
me. So I dug the spur in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;You said you would welcome a chance of exchanging
our mutual experiences in South Africa.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not feel the spur. &#8220;I have told you I
do not desire your acquaintance at all,&#8221; he said warmly,
adding with a sneer: &#8220;Are you Englishmen accustomed
to force yourselves upon one in the way you
are doing now?&#8221;</p>

<p>I let even this go in silence, and he crossed and
threw the door open. &#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; he said, in barrack-yard
style.</p>

<p>I rose then. &#8220;I think you had better not insist
on my going at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you think. Go. That&#8217;s all I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are deeply involved in a certain conspiracy,
Major Sampayo. I have absolute knowledge that
concerns you closely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is blackmail, eh?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You
want to force me to help you by threatening me. Well,
I refuse point-blank. Give what information you like.
You are a spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave him a steady look and answered very deliberately.
&#8220;You mistake me. I did not give the
information which led to that raid in the Rua Catania,
but&mdash;I know who did.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got right home with that thrust, and as he glared
at me, that old perplexed, speculative fear of me came
creeping back into his eyes. He tried to fight it back by
encouraging his rage. &#8220;Are you going to force me
to kick you out, you spy?&#8221; he cried fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;A spy is an object of contempt, quite kickable, of
course; but Dr. Barosa would probably regard a
traitor as infinitely more despicable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; he said, even more
angrily, but also with more fear.</p>

<p>I paused. &#8220;You forged the letter in my name.
I have the proofs here;&#8221; and I took out the letter and
held it up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>He burst into a loud scoffing laugh, the effort of which
was obvious. &#8220;You must have lost your senses.&#8221;
Even his voice was beginning to grow unsteady.</p>

<p>Having frightened him to this extent, I took a
chance. It was certain of course that he must have
carefully practised the copying of my handwriting
before he forged the letter, so I glanced round significantly
at his desk and said: &#8220;You are forgetting that
you have not been in this room for more than thirty
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an excellent bluff. He was scared right
through. He changed colour, and the quick look
which he shot involuntarily at the desk was instinct
with fear. It was several seconds before he could
recover himself sufficiently even to bluster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have no more of this,&#8221; he said with an oath and
came toward me threateningly.</p>

<p>I knew him to be a wretched coward and was not
in the least doubt that if he laid hands on me I could
more than hold my own; so I let him come, my eyes
fixed very steadily upon his. About two paces from
me he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I made no answer and no movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no mood to be trifled with.&#8221;</p>

<p>I let this go also without reply. I kept my eyes
steadily on his face, and saw the struggle between
his rage and his fear, and at one moment his rage all
but won. His face set viciously and he tried to conceal
his intention under an assumption of contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too contemptible to touch,&#8221; he said, as
he moved back and then turned to his desk.</p>

<p>For a moment he misled me. I thought he meant no
more by the insult than a cover for his cowardice.
But I soon changed my opinion. His back was toward
me, and I saw that while pretending to turn over his
papers, his left hand went stealthily to a drawer. I
guessed his intention.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>The purpose in his mind when he had meditated that
attack had not been to put me out of the room, but to
secure the proofs of his treachery which I said were in
my possession. He was looking now for a weapon
with which to force them from me.</p>

<p>To test him, as well as to interrupt his search, I made
a feint of leaving.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go now,&#8221; I said and stepped toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by Heaven, not until this thing is cleared,&#8221; he
cried, and rushing to the door he locked it, pocketed
the key, and hurried back to the desk.</p>

<p>Knowing the man, I had of course taken the precaution
of having my own weapon with me, and was
about to take it out when another thought struck me.</p>

<p>Instead of the revolver, I took out a letter from the
Corsican, Prelot, which had been forwarded to me
that morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there to be cleared up?&#8221; I asked, in the
same steady, stern tone I had used before.</p>

<p>He found his revolver then and holding it behind
him turned round. &#8220;You have made a lying charge
against me. You say you have the proofs. Give me
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I refuse to do anything of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will,&#8221; he replied, with a cunning leer,
and he covered me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare to threaten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand them over at once. Don&#8217;t fool me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you five seconds,&#8221; he thundered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had certain information in this letter,&#8221; and I
held up the Corsican&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I folded it up and threw it close to him.</p>

<p>With a chuckle he stooped and picked it up, and
as he began to read it I took out my own weapon.</p>

<p>The door was locked and he might be really dangerous
when he learnt the peril which menaced him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>IN THE FLUSH OF SUCCESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY precaution proved to be unnecessary.</p>

<p>As Sampayo read the first page of the letter
his expression was merely one of perplexity. Prelot
had begun with a recital of the places he had visited
since writing to me before, and this told nothing of
any significance.</p>

<p>Sampayo read it hurriedly and turning the page
glanced down at the signature.</p>

<p>He started violently, and stared at the words for
the space of a few seconds like a man bewitched. The
hectic flush of triumphant cunning changed to a deathly
grey. His hand shook so that the paper crackled;
then his teeth began to chatter; the trembling spread
to his limbs, and the whole of his big frame quivered
and shook till he reeled under the shock and had to
cling to the table for support.</p>

<p>His eyes all this time were fixed glassily on the signature
of the letter; his breath was laboured and stertorous
as he gasped for air; and he made frantic efforts
to fight against the palsy of terror. He failed. And
at length the revolver dropped from his nerveless
hand, the letter fluttered to the floor, and with a groan
he collapsed into the chair near him helpless, inert,
and unconscious, his bullocky head lolling over the
back with gaping mouth and staring but unseeing
eyes.</p>

<p>I laid him down on the floor, and pocketed his
revolver lest, when he recovered, he might have a fancy
to put a bullet in me. Then I helped myself to the key,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and having unlocked the door, put the key in my own
pocket.</p>

<p>Next I picked up Prelot&#8217;s letter and was beginning
to hunt round for some brandy when it occurred to
me to look in his desk to make sure that he had no
other weapons and also to see if there was any evidence
that he had been practising my handwriting. A hasty
search gave me just what I wanted. Hidden away
in a small drawer I found some sheets of paper on one
of which was the draft of the letter he had written in
his own handwriting; while among the others were
his first attempts at the forgery and with them a
letter of mine written to Volheno announcing my
arrival in Lisbon.</p>

<p>I concluded that Sampayo had been disturbed at
his work and had put the papers away hurriedly and
forgotten them.</p>

<p>Lastly I turned my attention to restoring him. I
found a decanter of brandy and gave him some. The
spirit soon began to take effect, and then I lit another
cigar and sat down to wait until he should be ready
to resume operations.</p>

<p>When at length he sat up he passed his hand
across his eyes in dazed bewilderment, as a man will
when awakened suddenly from an ugly dream. Then
with a start he began to stare about the floor as if
looking for the letter, and not seeing it he gave a
deep sigh of intense relief, apparently convinced that
the thing was no more than a nightmare horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking for that letter, I have it,&#8221; I
said quietly.</p>

<p>With a shuddering start at my voice&mdash;I was behind
him and he had not seen me&mdash;he swung round and
stared at me, and began to shake again as his terror
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you&#8217;d better have some more of this;&#8221; and
I poured him out a wine-glassful of brandy and gave it
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>He made one gulp of it and sat leaning forward,
trying to think. Presently he scrambled to his
feet and sank with a sigh into the chair, leant his
arms on the desk and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>For some few minutes&mdash;five probably&mdash;he remained
in this attitude of utter dejection. Then he let his
hands fall on the desk, turned his head slightly so that
he could see exactly where I was, and shifted his position
so that the action of his left hand should be hidden
by his body.</p>

<p>He was reaching for his revolver of course. A start
and a grunt of dismay announced his disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you feel steady enough to shoot, you&#8217;re fit to
talk,&#8221; I said sharply; &#8220;and we&#8217;ll get this thing
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a long pause before he spoke. &#8220;What
is it?&#8221; he murmured then, slowly and sullenly.</p>

<p>I gave him another shock then. Imitating Prelot&#8217;s
voice as nearly as I could recall it, I stamped my feet
and called out, &#8220;Ah, Jean Dufoire, at last!&#8221;</p>

<p>The effect was electrical. He sprang up and turned
round in a positive agony of terror.</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;I began to think you might have
forgotten your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a scowl of hate he flung a bitter curse at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s roused you anyway, and now listen
to me. You are either going to do exactly what I tell
you, or Lucien Prelot and Jean Dufoire will be face
to face before this time to-morrow. Now, which is it
to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Jean Dufoire?&#8221; he asked, after a long
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s your line, I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>

<p>He let me reach the door and felt in his pocket to
make sure that he had the key; but when I opened
it he started. &#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is it to be? Quick,&#8221; I said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you want.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>&#8220;Which is it to be?&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what you wish.&#8221; The words came slowly
as if the utterance of each one of them was a torture.</p>

<p>I returned to my seat. &#8220;In the first place, you
have a confession of Lieutenant de Linto&#8217;s. Give it
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With shaking fingers he unlocked a drawer of the
desk and from a secret recess in it took out a paper and
held it out.</p>

<p>I pushed a chair half-way between us. &#8220;Put it
there.&#8221; He obeyed. &#8220;Now write an admission that
you incited this young fool to take the money having
won large amounts from him by cheating at cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten Jean Dufoire&#8217;s reputation.
Write what I say&mdash;and sign it Jean Dufoire, now known
as Major Francisco Sampayo.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fought against this, but in the end yielded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now a confession that you wrote the letter in my
name giving information about the house in the Rua
Catania.&#8221;</p>

<p>Against this he fought more stubbornly than before,
but I showed him the papers I had taken from his desk,
vowing I would take them straight to Barosa, and
then he gave in. The sweat was standing in great
beads on his forehead as he placed the papers on the
chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now a letter to the Visconte de Linto and one to
Mademoiselle Dominguez renouncing all claim to her
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; he cried with an oath. &#8220;My hand shall
rot first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will do that soon after Lucien Prelot has found
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; he repeated, flinging down the pen.
&#8220;I dare not.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the slip of paper and wrote, speaking the
words as I pencilled them. &#8220;&#8216;Jean Dufoire is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
known as Major Francisco Sampayo. You will find
him in Lisbon.&#8217; That telegram I shall send within
five minutes of leaving here,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>With a groan he threw up his hands distractedly
and rising began to pace up and down. &#8220;I dare not.
I dare not,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I watched him very closely and observed that his
movements, at first erratic as if at the dictates of his
overpowering agitation, had a method suggestive of a
purpose. Each turn he took brought him a little
nearer to me. So I stood up and while pocketing the
papers he had written, I held my weapon in readiness,
questioning him the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by dare not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then make it plain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There is a limit to my compliance. I dare
not do this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you are afraid of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that. My lips are sealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh come, you weren&#8217;t afraid to betray your associates
when you thought to get me into a mess. Why
be afraid now, to get yourself out of one?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was pacing in my direction now and I made a
half turn from him as if to glance at his desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do it if I could, Heaven knows. You&#8217;ve
got me in a corner, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And at that instant he
sprang forward to grab me by the throat. I was
fully prepared, and instead of getting his hands on me
he threw them up and staggered back from my levelled
revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try that again,&#8221; I said between my teeth.
&#8220;And now do what I have told you&mdash;and do it at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He abandoned his intention to try force, and sat
down again at the desk, but he would not write the
letters.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not. I dare not. You must do what you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
will. I dare not,&#8221; he repeated, over and over again in
answer to my threats.</p>

<p>This persistent refusal perplexed me. That he was
in fear of his life I knew, for I had convinced him I
meant to set his enemy on his track. But there was
obviously something or some one of whom he was
even more afraid than of me. I could think of only
one man&mdash;Barosa. But why of him? And why
only in regard to breaking his engagement to Miralda?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so determined to marry Mademoiselle
Dominguez?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not. I will take any oath you like not to
marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is only the written renouncement you
shrink from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then write a letter to her asking her to release
you and to keep the whole thing secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so set on this?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t question me,&#8221; I snapped angrily.</p>

<p>He sat thinking in moody despair. He might well
despair being between the upper and nether millstones.
Then at length he took up the pen and began to write,
but stopped and tore up the sheet.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell her,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I renewed my threats, promising secrecy, but he
struggled hard and at length I got up and went to the
door, declaring I would at once dispatch the telegram
I had drafted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me time,&#8221; he said then. &#8220;Let me have a
week&mdash;three days&mdash;one day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he pleaded as I
shook my head. And at last he gave in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for my last condition,&#8221; I said as I took the
letter. &#8220;You will leave the city at once&mdash;to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me more time. I shall go of course after
this, but I must have some time&mdash;two days at least&mdash;to
make arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not one hour after to-day. If you are still in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the city to-morrow, this message will go to Lucien
Prelot.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that final shot I left him.</p>

<p>There was only a very small fly in the amber of my
satisfaction at the result of the interview. I had secured
all I wanted. I had caused the rupture of the
engagement to Miralda, had put an end to his hold
over her brother, had obtained the proofs of his
treachery toward Barosa, and had given him a
notice to quit which he would not dare to disobey.</p>

<p>The only point where I had failed had been in learning
that strange secret at the back of his fears which had
made him refuse to write the letter to the visconte.
It was in some way connected with the betrothal;
but beyond that, I could not even hazard a guess.</p>

<p>But I was in too high spirits at what I had gained
to worry over the minor failure. Indeed, the prospect
of a secret understanding with Miralda was so alluring
that I was more than half disposed to be glad that
the thing had taken this particular course, and decided
not to lose a minute before telling her the
news.</p>

<p>I was hurrying off to her when I remembered my
promise to have the money for Vasco. I had to get
it from the bank, and while I was there it occurred to
me to put the other papers I had forced from Sampayo
in safe custody. I sealed them up and left them in
the bank&#8217;s custody, with instructions that the packet
was not to be given to any one&mdash;only to myself in
person.</p>

<p>This precaution started another line of thought.
Sampayo was at bay, utterly desperate, fighting for
all he cared for in life, and I must reckon with that
and be on my guard.</p>

<p>What was he likely to do? He had attempted my
life once, even while he was only in doubt whether
I could harm him. What would he do now that he
knew and was desperate? I decided not to run the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
risk of being alone in my rooms until I knew that he
was out of Lisbon.</p>

<p>Instead of going straight to Miralda, therefore, I
drove down to the quay and sent off a message by a
boatman to Burroughs, my second in command on
the <i>Stella</i>, to come to my rooms with a couple of the
crew.</p>

<p>Jack Burroughs was just the man for such a purpose&mdash;a
&#8217;Varsity man of good birth but very small means,
with the roving instinct strongly developed, he had
been half over the globe in search of adventure; and
having a love of the sea, had jumped at my suggestion
that he should come with me, partly as companion
and partly to qualify himself to take command of the
<i>Stella</i> later on.</p>

<p>Having dispatched the message I drove back to
the visconte&#8217;s house. I was in luck, for Miralda was
alone when the servant showed me into the room.</p>

<p>She was not surprised by my visit and received me
with some little restraint. Her eyes were troubled and
her hand trembled as she placed it in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to find you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was expecting you, Mr. Donnington, but I am
afraid I am sorry you have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Expecting me? But no one except myself knew
I was coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the bearer of a letter, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you reading my thoughts? You amaze me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head and smiled sadly. &#8220;It is unfortunately
nothing occult. But I will ask you not
to give me the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath of surprise. &#8220;Do you know
what is in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but please do not question me. You are mixing
in matters which you cannot understand and I cannot
explain. But do not give me the letter&mdash;I&mdash;I could not
read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you not say why? This is so extraordinary.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;I know it must seem so to you. Oh, why do you
not leave the city?&#8221; she burst out impulsively.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the news I bring is good news&mdash;at least I hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please,&#8221; she interposed, holding up her
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t know the contents of the letter
why mustn&#8217;t you read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t question me. I cannot tell you. I would if I
might&mdash;I am sure you know that. But I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you I was coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head again, growing more and more
distressed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t offer it to me even. I must take
it if you do but must not read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat thinking a moment. I was almost dumbfounded
by this sudden check at the moment when
I had been so full of confidence. I had hoped
that the instant she saw the letter she would see that
the barrier between us was swept away for good.
And now she would not even look at it.</p>

<p>She dared not, just as Sampayo had not dared to
write the letter to the visconte. Was there any
connexion between her fear and his? Was this further
evidence of that mysterious power in the background?</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said at length; and at the words the
expression of her eyes changed.</p>

<p>But there are more ways than one of gaining an end,
and I was resolved she should know the contents of the
letter before I left; and once more I pressed those
Beira concessions into my service. I chatted at random
for a while and then spoke of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be glad to hear that I am getting along all
right in that matter,&#8221; I said in a casual tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad if it will mean that you will be able to
leave Lisbon,&#8221; she replied, a little suspicious as to
which concessions I meant.</p>

<p>I said a lot about Beira and the colony until I had
cleared the doubt from her eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
the matter stands,&#8221; I said then, and added quickly,
not heeding her attempts to interrupt me: &#8220;There was
a man here who tried to forestall me by using secret
means he possessed to force others, and to-day I have
seen him and he has given me a letter definitely renouncing
his claims and by to-morrow he will have left
Lisbon for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>She understood, but instead of showing relief or
pleasure, her eyes clouded again with trouble, and she
sat with drooped head biting her lip and pressing her
hands tightly together in agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no word of&mdash;of congratulation?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her congratulation was a deep sigh, a gesture of
despair, and a scarcely audible whisper: &#8220;It is too
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; I exclaimed firmly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t and won&#8217;t
believe that. And I hold too strong a hand now for
any one to beat me.&#8221;</p>

<p>My firmness told. She looked up with the dawn
of hope in her eyes, and if I could read it, something
beside hope, something far dearer to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;My hand on it,&#8221; I said, stretching it out.</p>

<p>She was about to place hers in it, when the servant
announced Inez. On watchdog duty again, of course.
I gave her the letter and whispered quickly: &#8220;Take
this now. You know what is in it. I have other
news for you&mdash;I have rescued Vasco.&#8221;</p>

<small>BAROSA&#8217;S SECRET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;STAYED a few minutes after Inez&#8217; arrival so
that she should not think she had scared me away,
and I left the house more in love with Miralda than
ever and convinced that had she been free the interview
would have had a very different result.</p>

<p>I saw Barosa&#8217;s sinister influence behind. Sampayo
had evidently told him at once what I had done; he
had instantly sent instructions to Miralda to take the
letter but not to read it; and his power over her was
too great for her to dare to disobey.</p>

<p>To break down his influence appeared impossible;
it meant a fight against the whole forces of this infernal
conspiracy. And then a somewhat wild, harum-scarum
alternative occurred to me&mdash;to carry her away
from it all on the <i>Stella</i>. Vasco was out of danger, and
so far as she herself was in danger from the Government,
she could smile at it when we were once in old England.</p>

<p>Vasco was already on the yacht. Could I use him
to get her there? And if I did, would she resent my
trick or come to view it as the best, if not the only way
out?</p>

<p>Burroughs was at my rooms when I arrived, and
he was just the man to help me in such a plan; but
I would not broach it until I had had more time to
think it round.</p>

<p>I was still undecided when Barosa arrived. I guessed
his object but greeted him pleasantly. He was,
however, too engrossed by the reasons which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
brought him to make any sort of pretence, and the
moment we had shaken hands, he plunged into the
subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see you about Major Sampayo, Mr.
Donnington. I regret to hear that you and he have
quarrelled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely quarrelled, doctor. At least I should
not use that term; and pardon me if I say that it is
a strictly personal matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot regard it so; that is why I have come. You
have threatened to use certain information you possess
and have required him to leave Lisbon at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should put it very differently, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We need not split hairs,&#8221; he replied bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care to be addressed quite so curtly, Dr.
Barosa. If you wish to tell me anything or to make
any sort of request, I am willing to listen in a friendly
spirit. But not otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no wish to offend, but the matter is serious.
I have explained to you once before that we are under
great obligations to Major Sampayo, and any action
directed against him is felt to be directed equally
against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I cannot take that view. I have nothing
to do with your aims or concerns or plans. My
action is strictly individual. But perhaps you will
put in plain terms exactly what you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That your persecution of Major Sampayo shall
cease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecution! There is no persecution. Are you
aware that he even attempted my life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for a moment, Mr. Donnington. You refer
to the Rua Catania letter. That has all been explained.
He was not satisfied that you would keep your pledge of
secrecy and intended that merely as a test.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that he has persuaded you to believe
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Otherwise I should not say it, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t, and nothing would ever make me.
He forged my name to the letter and managed to let
you know of it somehow in his belief that you would
deal with me as a liar and traitor. I know the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. And the fact that he warned us of the
raid so that nothing should be discovered satisfies me
of his good faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, we must be content to differ about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not forget that he had stronger cause for
distrusting you than we had. We believed that you
had come here for very different reasons from
those openly given&mdash;reasons which touched him very
closely indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he think I came after him, do you mean?&#8221;
I asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; he replied, nettled by my
smile,&mdash;as, indeed, I intended he should be. &#8220;He
believed that you had come on a very different person&#8217;s
account.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why did he fight shy of mentioning Miralda by
name? And why was he himself so interested in
forcing Sampayo to marry her, when the man himself
had offered to take any oath I wished that he
would not? &#8220;I don&#8217;t care a rap what he believed,&#8221;
I said, after a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we care, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused and then asked sharply: &#8220;What is
Miralda Dominguez to you, Dr. Barosa?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question took him by surprise, and the sudden
light which gleamed in his eyes answered my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is nothing to me, personally, of course,&#8221; he
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;You misunderstand my question. What is she
to you and your friends?&#8221; It was not prudent yet
to show him that I believed I had guessed his secret
of secrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is one of us, Mr. Donnington. She is in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
position to render our cause valuable help, as she has
already done. It is more to the point to ask what she
is to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had another shaft ready, but to prepare the
way for the surprise I paused, gave a shrug and a
smile of indifference, and then said quickly: &#8220;I
hope to make her my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the sudden flame in his eyes confirmed
my former diagnosis.</p>

<p>&#8220;That will not be possible, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see. I doubt if I am more easily turned
from a course I have once taken than you yourself.
I&#8217;ll tell you how I view the thing, for it is the pith
and marrow of this business with Sampayo. I came
here for the express purpose of asking her to become
my wife. I found her promised to Major Sampayo.
I set my wits to work and my money, and ascertained
that she had been driven to compromise herself
in your politics. By means of money I succeeded
in learning how she had been forced to join you. My
whip-hand over Sampayo led him to admit that he
did not really wish to marry her&mdash;and I found that
you were really the background force which made
him shrink from an open rupture with her. He agreed
to a secret one and gave me a letter to her. I took
that letter and she absolutely refused to open it. I
saw, therefore, that Sampayo had been to you and
that you had ordered her not to read it. Now I&#8217;ve
spoken frankly and invite similar freedom from you.
Why did you do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot explain to you without entering into
matters that are secret&mdash;political matters, I mean,
of course,&#8221; he replied, making the addition quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. Then you come to me and tell me
that I must not do as I please with regard to Sampayo.
You call it persecution. I apply that term to
Mademoiselle Dominguez&#8217; treatment. Cease that,
give her back her freedom of action, and I&#8217;ve done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
with Sampayo. He can stop here or go to the devil
for all I care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you it is not possible, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that you, for motives personal to
yourself, will not permit it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no reason to draw any such inference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do draw it, and shall continue to believe
it and act upon it until I learn it is wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you it is wrong, wholly wrong and preposterous.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked at him with a purposely aggravating smile
and shook my head. &#8220;As a matter of fact, I know,&#8221;
I said. Pure bluff this, of course, but useful.</p>

<p>He paled with anger and his eyes flashed again.
&#8220;You wish to insult me,&#8221; he said between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not regard it as an insult if you suggested
that I admired a very beautiful woman, but
if I got as angry as you are, you would conclude that
you were right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang up. &#8220;Then you intend to disregard
my warning and set us all at defiance,&#8221; he cried, beside
himself with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you threatening me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it as you will, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I
knew he was the agent of the Pretender and reply
to his threat with one to denounce him to Volheno.
But I checked myself. &#8220;You understand I shan&#8217;t
take it lying down. I shall hit back. And now I
think we are at the end of this stage of the affair,&#8221;
I said; and he left me.</p>

<p>It was evidently a fight to be with the gloves off,
and I might look for trouble without any fear of
being disappointed. But I should be on my guard.</p>

<p>I had gained more than a warning by the interview,
however. I had learnt the secret which had
been in the background. Barosa was in love with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Miralda; and Sampayo was only the stalking-horse
to keep other men away until he could declare himself.
I could not resist a smile at his dilemma. He
could not do anything at present without changing
Inez from friend to enemy and I saw how this
interesting embarrassment could be turned to excellent
account with her.</p>

<p>But the axis of things was shifted. It was not
Sampayo who had so tortuously woven the web which
had entangled Miralda. It was Barosa himself. And
then came the question why Sampayo had been so
pliant a tool in his hands and so frightened of him.
There was one probable answer to that&mdash;that Barosa
knew what I knew about that South African villainy.</p>

<p>Vasco arrived when I was turning over the problem.
I told him that I had obtained his confession from
Sampayo and that the latter would not trouble him
any more; and he thanked me profusely, making
earnest protestations that he would never touch a card
or a dicebox again as long as he lived. Men generally
make resolutions of that sort at such a moment, of
course. He told me how much he owed to his fellow-officers,
and I gave him the amount.</p>

<p>Then I suggested that he should return to the
<i>Stella</i> until Sampayo had left Lisbon. This was not
my real reason. I really wished to have him on
board in case I should decide upon the drastic step
of carrying off Miralda and could use him to get her
to go to the yacht.</p>

<p>But he jumped away from the suggestion as if it
were a red-hot iron. &#8220;I am sorry I cannot, Mr.
Donnington. I&#8217;ll do anything else, but to-morrow
I must go on duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked with surprise at his exaggerated
love of discipline.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me that. I cannot tell you. I
cannot really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve told me a good deal.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;d tell you anything else. You&#8217;re the best
friend a fellow could have. But this is not my secret.
Please don&#8217;t question me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not your secret, eh? Then it&#8217;s some of this
conspiracy business. It strikes me you&#8217;re going to
make a fool of yourself. You&#8217;d much better have
nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t say any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. By the way, you wanted to have my
yacht for a day?&#8221;</p>

<p>His tell-tale face was instantly so troubled that I
took it he connected the question with what I had
said before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t want it, thank you,&#8221; he said quickly;
and added with stammering hesitation: &#8220;You see,
I&#8217;ve given up the idea of taking those fellows out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But all I was going to suggest was
that you should come for another outing with me
and perhaps get your sister to join you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do that any time&mdash;but not to-morrow,
or&mdash;or the next day. Any other time. I know
Miralda would go&mdash;at least&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll fix a day soon,&#8221; I said, and let him
go.</p>

<p>Evidently something serious was to take place on
the morrow. What could it be? Was it something
I ought to know for Miralda&#8217;s sake? Clearly the
sooner I could get her away the better.</p>

<p>Later in the evening Burroughs told me a curious
incident. We were smoking, and he broke one of
the pauses with a sudden laugh. &#8220;A rum thing
happened yesterday,&#8221; he said, in response to my
glance of surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, is the king of this benighted country in the
habit of playing the Haroun Al Raschid game?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it looks like it. I was on the Quay yesterday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
and some of the loafers began looking at me and
nudging one another and chattering&mdash;you know
what beggars they are for that&mdash;and the thing went
on until there were two or three dozen of &#8217;em gawking
around. I was walking away when hang me if the
whole lot didn&#8217;t off with the caps and sing out &#8216;Long
Live the King.&#8217; I looked round for the King, but
he wasn&#8217;t there, and when I was going back in the
launch to the <i>Stella</i> afterwards, one of the hands
told me the crowd had taken me for him, and were
pretty huffy because I hadn&#8217;t acknowledged the cheer.
Wish I&#8217;d tumbled to it, I&#8217;d have played up to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprisingly like him, Jack, now that I
look at you,&#8221; I said with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather be myself, a heap,&#8221; he replied drily, and
after some chaff the matter dropped.</p>

<p>I had been considering how to tell him about
Miralda, and after the next pause I asked him if
he knew why we were in Lisbon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me,&#8221; he replied drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you have guessed?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took his pipe out of his mouth, glanced at it,
and then at me and smiled. &#8220;I know the symptoms.
I&#8217;ve had the fever myself. You&#8217;re the sort to take
it badly too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All sorts and plenty of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m with you, if you want me. I&#8217;d love a
scrap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of making a bolt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Stella?</i>&#8221; I nodded. &#8220;The lady willing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I haven&#8217;t asked her. She&#8217;s been
forced to give a promise to some one else. I&#8217;d better
tell you something about it;&#8221; and I gave him a
short outline of the position.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mix up, sure,&#8221; he commented drily. &#8220;But
she&#8217;s a lovely girl. That&#8217;s a cert.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man has eyes, I suppose. She&#8217;s a good sailor
too. Seemed to enjoy that bit of a racket on the
yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I said, self-consciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can get her to put one of her dainty feet
into a rowing boat, I&#8217;ll answer for it that she doesn&#8217;t
take it out again except to mount the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> companion,
and the rest would be as easy as shooting
gulls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how to do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, shook his pipe out, refilled it and lit
it. &#8220;If you leave it to me, I&#8217;d undertake to do it
all right,&#8221; he said very deliberately.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said leave it to me. I&#8217;ll tell you how when it&#8217;s
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve never spoken to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should ask her first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And spoil your chance. Ask her when we&#8217;re
half-way across the bay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may have to come to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better come first,&#8221; he said with his dry smile.
&#8220;If you want to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was my own thought secretly; but I was half
afraid Miralda herself might resent such a strong
step.</p>

<p>We lapsed into silence and I sat thinking over the
whole situation, and the longer I thought the stronger
grew my conviction that to get Miralda away was at
once the safest and simplest solution of all the difficulties.
If she would go, of course. Would she?
I could only answer that out of the hopes which her
look that afternoon had roused. If she were free, I
was certain of her. And free she certainly would
be if I dared to carry her off in the <i>Stella</i>.</p>

<p>Presently we began to speak of another matter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
We were sitting at the open window with no light
except from that of the full moon, and Burroughs
went out on to the verandah and leant over, looking
about curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think there may be something
happen to-night by having us up here?&#8221; he asked
as he sat down again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely likely, but I thought best to be prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s turning-in time. I&#8217;ll keep the first watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you seen?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;except that any one could get in here
easily enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any fear of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t talking about fear of anything. But I
shan&#8217;t turn in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither shall I, yet. I couldn&#8217;t sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon we don&#8217;t want to show &#8217;em
they&#8217;re expected;&#8221; and he got up and closed the
window. &#8220;And we shall have plenty of other time
to talk, so we&#8217;ll keep a close lip. From what you
told me, this is the night they&#8217;re most likely to try
some hanky-panky. I guess, too, we don&#8217;t want
too fresh smoke for &#8217;em to smell, so I&#8217;ll shake my
pipe out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so and drew his chair away from the window,
and I followed his example.</p>

<p>I was wrong about not being able to sleep. After
a time I dozed off and, at Burroughs&#8217; suggestion,
lay down on a sofa close to him and went off into a
sound sleep.</p>

<p>From a dream that I was being smothered I awoke
to find a hand pressed tightly on my mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh! Wake up. Something&#8217;s happening,&#8221;
whispered Burroughs.</p>

<p>I looked round the room. It was almost dark, for
the moonlight was no longer streaming through the
window. I had evidently been asleep some hours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Then Burroughs caught my sleeve and pulled it
upwards. A sign to me to get up.</p>

<p>When I stood up he put his lips to my ear and
whispered: &#8220;You stay this side of the window.
I&#8217;ll go to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without making a sound he crept away from me.</p>

<p>I stood listening intently, and presently bent down
and peered cautiously at the window.</p>

<p>There was neither sign nor sound of anything.</p>

<p>The seconds of suspense lengthened into minutes.</p>

<p>Burroughs had clearly deceived himself.</p>

<p>And just when I was on the point of telling him so,
the form of a man showed on the verandah.</p>

<p>In a second I was on my feet again in the shadow
of the curtain.</p>

<p>Cautiously the window was pushed open. A man
entered and stood motionless as a statue, listening
and peering round the room.</p>

<p>With absolutely noiseless tread he stepped forward
a couple of paces, paused again, and then returned
to the balcony.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes passed before he re-entered,
this time with a companion. The second man remained
close to the window.</p>

<p>The small circle light of an electric lamp carried by
the first comer flashed for an instant, and then he
started to cross the room.</p>

<small>A LITTLE CHESS PROBLEM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as the two men were separated in this way,
I realized that Burroughs had made a mistake
in tactics. We ought to have stayed together. As
it was, I did not know which of the two he meant to
tackle.</p>

<p>It turned out that he was in the same uncertainty
about me; but he saw that the man who had crossed
the room was going to switch on the electric light,
and to prevent this he sprang on him and shouted to
me to seize the other fellow.</p>

<p>I might as well have tried to seize a stroke of lightning.
Before my companion had half finished his
sentence, the man was out of the room and over the
balcony railing, and it would have been sheer folly
to attempt any pursuit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Burroughs, who was as strong as a
bullock, had collared his man, holding his hands
behind him in a grip of iron.</p>

<p>I closed the jalousies and fastened them, and then
shut the window and fastened that, and then switched
up the light.</p>

<p>I recognized the prisoner immediately. It was
Henriques&mdash;the brute who had been going to strike
Inez that night in the Rua Catania.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run your hands over him and draw his teeth,&#8221;
said my friend.</p>

<p>He had both a revolver and a knife, and I took
these from him and then turned out his pockets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
Among the miscellaneous contents I found, to my
intense surprise, an envelope addressed to Vasco,
the name being given in full.</p>

<p>I was careful not to show my keen interest at this,
and something like a flash of intuition warned me
that I must learn the contents of the letter without
Henriques knowing that I had read it. As the envelope
was fastened, this was a little difficult. &#8220;These
things may be wanted by the police and may or may
not be important,&#8221; I said to Burroughs. Then I
fetched a sheet of paper from my desk, wrapped up
the envelope and the small things and sealed the
packet, placing the revolver and knife by them. I
did it very deliberately so that Henriques should
see, and then I said to him: &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to
give you a chance to deny that these thing were
found on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I send for the police?&#8221; asked Burroughs,
who was considerably perplexed by what I had done.</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends upon this scoundrel. You needn&#8217;t
hold him. He can&#8217;t do any harm. But don&#8217;t let
him get near these toys of his,&#8221; and I pointed to his
weapons. I had my plan by that time. I meant
to trick him, and it was part of my plan that he
should believe that the packet was not out of his
sight the whole time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you make a clean breast of things, I
shall let you go,&#8221; I said, turning to the man. &#8220;What&#8217;s
your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Garcia Rosada.&#8221; He lied so promptly that I
saw he had been carefully making up his tale.</p>

<p>I was on the point of telling him I knew his name,
when it occurred to me that it would be better to
affect to believe him. &#8220;Who sent you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you come then?&#8221;</p>

<p>He hung his head for a moment as if in shame
and then muttered: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been a thief before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
and if you&#8217;ll let me go, Excellency, I vow to the
Holy Virgin I&#8217;ll never be one again. Have mercy
on me. I&#8217;ve a wife and five children and this will&mdash;will
kill them.&#8221; He was an artful scoundrel, and
the break in his voice was quite cleverly done.</p>

<p>I put a few more questions, and he improved on
the tale, saying that his companion was name Ferraz,
and having heard that I was a very rich man, had
tempted him to try and rob me.</p>

<p>Burroughs&#8217; face, when he saw that I appeared to
believe the yarn, was quite an amusing study. He
was divided between doubt whether I was really
gulled, and curiosity as to my object, if I was not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll write that down while it&#8217;s fresh in my memory.
If I find your story true, I won&#8217;t punish you, Rosada,&#8221;
I said and turned away to my writing table. I made
a pretence of writing, repeating the words aloud and
turning now and then to put a question about some
detail.</p>

<p>But what I really did was to make up a dummy
packet the exact counterfeit of that on the table.</p>

<p>As soon as it was ready I crossed again to Henriques.
&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing you haven&#8217;t explained,&#8221;
I said, picking up the revolver. &#8220;Why did you
bring this and the knife with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had his tale ready, good enough for such a
fool as he deemed me. &#8220;They are not mine at all,
Excellency. They belong to Ferraz&mdash;the man who
got me into this.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put a question or two; and then as if in doubt
I turned to replace the revolver and stood for a moment
in such a position that he could not see me exchange
the packets.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe that, do you?&#8221; exclaimed
Burroughs, with a scoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know quite what to believe yet,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over;&#8221; and I returned to my
desk, and while keeping up the farce of writing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
asking occasional questions, I opened the packet and
took out the letter to Vasco.</p>

<p>It was very insecurely fastened, fortunately, so
that I could open it without showing any signs that
it had been tampered with. As I read it, I found it
was from Dagara, and could scarcely restrain a laugh
of chagrin at the elaborate means I had taken to
discover a mare&#8217;s nest.</p>

<p>It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Lisbon Chess Club.</span></span><br />
<span class="smcap">438, Rua da Gloria.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Lieutenant de Linto</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sorry you could not be at the Club last night.
We had a most interesting series of problems set by
M. Polski, the Polish champion. There were ten of
them and the fifth and sixth will interest you&mdash;both
forced mates in seven moves. I hope that all our
playing members will find or make an opportunity
of studying them very thoroughly. I shall have them
printed, of course, and am writing in this strain to all
the members who were not present.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so anxious to see the general average of play
improved before we meet the Sanatarem Club.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">&#8220;Yours sincerely,</span><br />
&#8220;<span class="smcap">Manoel Dagara</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>Feeling very much like a man who has most ridiculously
hoaxed himself, I refolded the letter, put it
back carefully into the envelope, and was about to
fasten it when a thought struck me.</p>

<p>Vasco a chess player! The most unlikely man
in all Christendom to have that profoundly staid disease.
And why should this Henriques be chosen to
carry such a letter and have it on him in the dead of
night when he had come on such a grim mission as had
brought him here?</p>

<p>Then a reason suggested itself. He must have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
instructions to deliver it in person to Vasco; and
as the latter had been on the <i>Stella</i> from the previous
night, the note could not be delivered. The man in
such a case, being afraid to leave it about, might well
prefer to have it on him.</p>

<p>This meant that it was of much more importance
than its contents suggested; and my thoughts flew
to the cipher.</p>

<p>I was glad now that I had taken all the trouble and
I took some more. I made an exact copy of the
letter, laying a sheet of very thin paper over it and using
the utmost pains to space every word and letter exactly
as it was written.</p>

<p>Then I fastened it up and made up another packet
and returned to Burroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am still undecided what to do,&#8221; I said to him.
&#8220;If this man&#8217;s tale is true, I shan&#8217;t punish him. But
he must stop here for the present, of course. Have
him locked in a room and let a couple of men be
with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I made another exchange of the packets and
said to Henriques. &#8220;You can&#8217;t have your weapons,
but you can keep this.&#8221; And I gave it him.</p>

<p>Burroughs took him out of the room and was back
again in a minute or two, his face one staring note of
interrogation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil does it all mean?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an honest fellow that, Jack. He&#8217;s been led
into trouble by evil companions and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, rats!&#8221; he broke in. &#8220;What were you writing
there? You had me guessing all the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only writing this;&#8221; and I showed him the
copy of the letter.</p>

<p>He read it and scratched his head. &#8220;What is it?
A prize puzzle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a copy of the letter I took from our friend&#8217;s
pocket.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you wrapped it up in the parcel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have me rob a gentleman of his
belongings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the blessed thing was on the table all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean this?&#8221; and I produced the dummy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on me,&#8221; he said with a laugh. He was very
American at times in his idioms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m either a big stupid ass and have taken a lot of
trouble for nothing, or I&#8217;ve made a useful discovery.
I shall soon know which,&#8221; I said explaining how I had
changed the packets.</p>

<p>Then I fetched the cipher key which I had hidden
in another room and returned to find him puffing at
his pipe and puzzling over the copy of the letter.</p>

<p>I told him then about the discovery of the cipher,
and laid the key over the lines getting more nonsense
words from the first two or three. Then I read the
letter again and a thought struck me.</p>

<p>Dagara spoke of ten problems. There were ten
lines in the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fifth and sixth will interest you,&#8221; ran the
phrase.</p>

<p>I laid the punctured slip over these in turn. The
fifth gave me this result. I will put the indicated
letters in capitals.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoPe that All our Playing mEmbeRS will find
oR make.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P A P E R S R,&#8221; was shown up.</p>

<p>I laid the same row of holes over the next line, with
no results that were intelligible. The second row was
no more fruitful, but the third gave this result.</p>

<p>&#8220;an EArly opportunity of stuDying them thoroughlY.&#8221;</p>

<p>Put together the two lines of indicated letters read&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;PAPERS READY&#8221;&mdash;easy enough for Macaulay&#8217;s
schoolboy to understand. &#8220;Papers Ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a stupid ass after all,&#8221; I exclaimed, triumphantly.
&#8220;Now we want our considering caps. This
means that some important information which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
writer of this letter has obtained is waiting to be delivered,
and what we have to do is to get hold of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not in my line,&#8221; said Burroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sleep over it. We&#8217;re not likely to
have any more callers, so I shall go to bed;&#8221; and to
bed I went, leaving him on watch, as he declared he
should sit up till daylight.</p>

<p>In the morning I decided what to do. It was clear
that the papers were too important to be trusted by
Dagara to any one but a duly selected messenger.
The care with which the message was sent to
Vasco that they were ready, suggested that he was not
that messenger. Why then should he be told about
them? Probably he had to send the messenger for
them.</p>

<p>I thought it over carefully, revolving all I knew, and
by the process of exclusion decided it was Miralda. It
must be some one whom Vasco could see at any time,
the moment the message reached him. Even with
Inez, of whom I thought first, this was not practicable.
It might be some fellow-officer; but no one of them
would be so invariably within immediate touch as
Miralda.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was just the thing for which she could
be used to the best advantage. Dagara was married
I knew, and thus she would only have to pay an informal
visit to the wife for him to meet her and hand over
any papers. Then I recalled that Inez had been one
of the first to see that forged letter of mine which
Dagara had given up, and the conclusion was easy
that when Miralda obtained anything, she handed
it on to Inez for the latter to give to Barosa.</p>

<p>The inference was strong enough for me to risk
acting upon it. I could not, of course, be certain that
Miralda went to Dagara&#8217;s house for any communications,
while that I should go there was out of the
question. I decided therefore to try my hand at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
cipher message in Miralda&#8217;s name telling Dagara to
bring the papers to a spot where I could meet him,
and then take him to the only safe place for such an
interview as ours would be&mdash;on the <i>Stella</i>.</p>

<p>I must contrive to get him there secretly. I remembered
a very little-used landing-stage on the east
of the city round the point, where I could have my
launch ready, and I soon saw a way of getting Dagara
to that spot.</p>

<p>The message I sent in cipher was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Usual place unsafe. M. waiting now in the Praca
da Figueira for papers.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>I wrapped this up in a long letter answering his
about the chess problems, addressed it to Dagara at
Volheno&#8217;s and sent Bryant to leave it at the office.</p>

<p>I had meanwhile bundled Burroughs off to bring
the launch to the landing-stage, and I timed the delivery
of the letter to reach Dagara just about his dinner
interval.</p>

<p>If the scheme failed, I resolved as an alternative
to find out where he lived and risk a visit to his house
to frighten the papers out of him.</p>

<p>I had a carriage in readiness as I intended to drive
him in it to the landing-stage; and I was not a little
excited as I started for the Praca da Figueira&mdash;a quiet
little square close to my flat.</p>

<p>I left the carriage out of sight and as I turned the
corner leisurely I felt a little thrill of satisfaction to
see that he was there before me.</p>

<p>I had worked out my chess problem successfully and
saw my way to mate in less than his seven moves.</p>

<p>He was walking slowly with his back toward me,
and I quickened up my pace so that I was close to
him when he heard my footsteps, turned and saw me.</p>

<small>DAGARA&#8217;S STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS a great deal more pleased to see Dagara
than he was to see me, judging by the way in
which he took my hand and the little nervous
shrinking movement as I linked my arm in his and
turned back with him toward the carriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I am a little late, but I have made all
the haste I could,&#8221; I said with a smile of apology which
perplexed him considerably.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have an appointment then? I myself am&mdash;am
waiting for a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My appointment is with you, of course. There
is a change in the plans and I have come to fetch you.
I have a carriage here for the purpose. I was delighted
to come. I want to ask your opinion about something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t quite understand, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fact is I want to talk chess with you&mdash;about
M. Polski&#8217;s ten problems, and particularly the fifth
and sixth.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face turned to the colour of the paving stones
he was staring at so intently, and his voice was as
husky as if half the dust of the city had got into his
throat when he muttered: &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my carriage. Jump in, and we&#8217;ll chat it
over as we drive.&#8221; I had already told the driver
where to go.</p>

<p>Dagara had no jump left in him, poor fellow, and
tried to refuse to get in at all. But with my help he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
stumbled in and sat staring helplessly at me, as I
talked a lot of nonsense about chess&mdash;to give him time
to pull himself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you taking me, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
he asked when I had chattered myself almost out of
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is driving us down to a landing-stage and I&#8217;m
going to give you some lunch on my yacht. I have
had a desire for a chat with you for several days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am much obliged to you, Mr. Donnington, but I
cannot go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense. I&#8217;ll make excuses to M. Volheno.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I will not go. I won&#8217;t be forced in this way,&#8221;
he cried, striving hard to rally his courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I won&#8217;t force you. I&#8217;ll stop the
carriage.&#8221; I leant forward as if to call to the driver,
and then turned with a meaning look. &#8220;By the way,
did you find that missing letter the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean. I demand to get
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know why it was missing, M. Dagara. Would
you rather lunch with me or shall we return together
to M. Volheno? Decide quickly, please. It must
be one or the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a sobbing breath of fright; and all thought
of resistance was abandoned.</p>

<p>I let him frighten himself thoroughly until we were
nearing the landing-stage. &#8220;Now I want you to understand
things. I shall either be one of the best friends
you ever had or I shall ruin you lock, stock and barrel.
That rests with you. I know all you have been doing
and what your appointment was for to-day. Give
me the papers you have and tell me candidly all you
know about these people&#8217;s plans, and I shall be the
friend. Refuse, and I shall be the reverse. And I
can be a very ugly enemy, M. Dagara. We shall not
talk on the way to the yacht and you will have ample
time to think over your position and decide. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
must have the papers at once, lest you should take a
fancy to pitch them into the harbour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated in positively pitiful fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not give them to me now without trouble,
my men on the launch will take them from you by
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>That threat had a wholesome effect. After a moment
he handed me an envelope which I pocketed, and
he gave no more trouble.</p>

<p>In consequence of some repairs to the roadway
the carriage had to stop some fifty yards short of
the landing-stage, but he walked to the launch without
demur, and when I told him to conceal himself
in the little cabin he obeyed at once.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached the <i>Stella</i> I led him into
the saloon. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll have your decision, Dagara,&#8221;
I said sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you really try to shield me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I give you my word&mdash;but no half measures,
mind. I know quite enough to test the truth of all
you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the most miserable man in Portugal, Mr.
Donnington, and this double life is killing me;&#8221; and
then out came his story.</p>

<p>It was very similar to Vasco&#8217;s case&mdash;except that
Dagara&#8217;s wife had been the means of his undoing.
She had friends among the revolutionaries and had
been in league with them some time before he discovered
it. She had wormed things out of him, as wives can
and do out of husbands who love and trust them, and
had handed on the information to her friends.</p>

<p>Barosa had learnt this and naturally jumped at the
chance of getting a man in such a position into his
clutches. It was not difficult to lay a trap for him,
and he found himself suddenly faced with the alternative
of giving a little information of a comparatively
harmless description, or of seeing the wife he loved
denounced to the Government as a revolutionary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>Love for wife triumphed over fealty to employer,
and the information was given. It concerned only some
arrangements for the disposition of a body of troops
and police on one occasion when the king was returning
to the capital from a shooting party. But it was given
in writing&mdash;Barosa took good care of that, of course&mdash;and
from that hour Dagara was a bond-slave and had
never known a minute&#8217;s peace of mind.</p>

<p>By degrees, cunningly progressive, information of
increasing secrecy and importance had been extorted
from him until even his wife was scared out of her
senses and the man himself driven to regard suicide
as offering the only prospect of relief from unbearable
torture.</p>

<p>I was right in my guess that Miralda had been used
lately as a go-between. She knew the wife, and
Vasco had been dastard enough to induce his sister
to fetch one or two communications from Dagara,
without telling her their nature. She had then been
allowed to discover their treasonable character, and
had immediately refused to carry any more. Then
the screw was turned. She was already compromised
and her name as a suspect would be given up. She
had resisted strenuously, answering threat with threat,
but the thing had been done cleverly, and the only
people she was at that time in a position to harm were
the Dagaras, her friends, and her own brother. The
latter&#8217;s prosecution for the theft he had confessed was
the next menace, and this had driven her to yield,
and so, like Dagara, she had become hopelessly entangled
in the net.</p>

<p>This was almost all that Dagara could tell me. I
put a guarded question about the Visconte de Linto,
but he declared with the exception of Miralda, Henriques
and a friend of his wife&#8217;s, he did not know the name of
another person in the conspiracy. Henriques was
the caretaker of the building in which the chess club
met, and carried his letters to Vasco.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>The reason for this caution on Barosa&#8217;s part was
clear. He knew that Dagara had a very weak backbone
and that at any moment a fit of remorse might
seize him in which he would reveal all he knew to
Volheno. He was therefore allowed to know as little
as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know what use is made of the information
you have given from time to time?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I can see, it has been of comparatively
little use. I have told them from time to time the
objects and plans of the police and have warned them
when suspicion has fallen on certain individuals, or
when raids have been planned. The threatened persons
have disappeared and the raids have brought no result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You warned them about me and gave them that
letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But in regard to that a curious thing occurred.
I received a communication in the cipher warning
me to look out for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood this of course. In his eagerness that
the attempt against me should not misfire, Sampayo
had sent the warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are these men&#8217;s plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. They are of course in league
against the Government, but what they mean to do
I have no idea. That uncertainty is the heaviest part
of my burden. It weighs on me night and day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us deal with these papers in particular,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;What is the information in them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ordered to ascertain the movements of the
police and troops to-morrow evening when the King
returns to the city from a shooting expedition. Except
that in this case I had to get fuller details and
quite exact particulars; the information is no more
than I have supplied before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose any demonstration is to take
place against him or any attempt made to harm him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid,&#8221; he cried instantly agitated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;Is there anything in the arrangements differing
from those which are usually made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is. His Majesty is not supposed to be
returning for another week and is only remaining for
the one night. He has expressly ordered that the
customary arrangements shall be omitted both on his
arrival and on his departure the following morning
early. He wishes the matter to be kept quite secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at this. &#8220;Tell me the police
arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all there,&#8221; he replied pointing to the
papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me generally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be very few police or military present.
He crosses from Barreiro in an ordinary launch&mdash;not
the royal launch&mdash;and instead of going to the Quay,
he will land at the Eastern landing-stage&mdash;the one
from which you brought me to-day. He will be
accompanied only by two members of the shooting
party, and three or four officers will be present to receive
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of any particular regiment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The First Battalion of the Royal Guards.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the regiment in which Sampayo was a
major and Vasco lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment. Is not the loyalty of that regiment
suspected?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; he replied decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But M. Volheno said something of the sort to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Volheno was only trying to draw some admissions
from you, Mr. Donnington. He dictated to me
a <i>pr&eacute;cis</i> of his conversation with you that morning;
and I knew at once what his object had been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A private carriage will be in waiting for his Majesty,
and he and his two companions will drive in that to the
Palace.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;But a carriage cannot get any closer to the stage
than ours to-day&mdash;that is some forty or fifty yards
from the landing-place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His Majesty has used that stage more than once
when returning privately to the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since you have been giving away this information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, once&mdash;about six weeks ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will that part be policed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It never is. His Majesty does not go in fear of
any section of his people. He ridicules the very suggestion
of such a thing, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And M. Franco and M. Volheno?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are of the same opinion so far as the capital is
concerned. Of course, it would be different in Oporto.
The revolutionaries are strong there. But in Lisbon
there is no more than discontent which the police can
suppress.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand. Now, would it take you long to
make a copy of these papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An hour, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do so while you are having something to eat. I
wish to think things over.&#8221; I left him at the work and
going on deck nearly tumbled over Burroughs, who
was staring intently at some object through the most
powerful glass we had on the yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t show yourself, Ralph. Come here a moment,&#8221;
and he pulled me under the lee of the pinnace
behind which he was screening his action.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve infected me with some of your suspicions,
and as you said last night about yourself, I&#8217;m either
a stupid ass or I&#8217;ve made a discovery which may be
important. I&#8217;ve been watching the people on that
boat there&mdash;the one with the grey hull and sharp lines.
She&#8217;s called the <i>Rampallo</i>. She came in yesterday,
and the old man tells me the whole of her crew were
discharged soon after you sent for me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s that to us? We don&#8217;t want any
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she hasn&#8217;t taken on another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose her skipper or owner can please himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the skipper went with the crew as well. And
when I came off this morning to fetch the launch, I
saw that tall young dandy on board her&mdash;the fellow
who was out with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil you did!&#8221; I exclaimed, with suddenly
roused interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been two or three boats out to her this
morning, and what can any one be wanting in a yacht
with no crew on board?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have a squint at her,&#8221; I said, taking the
glass and training it on her. She was a nice craft,
about 250 tonnage; her sharp lines suggested a good
turn of speed; and everything about her was as smart
as one expects to see it in a private yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;What drew my attention to her,&#8221; said Burroughs
at my elbow, &#8220;was that I saw some one carefully
scanning us through a glass, and I thought I&#8217;d return
the compliment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was he like?&#8221;</p>

<p>The description he gave fitted no one whom I knew.
&#8220;He&#8217;s been at it more than once since. The old man
has noticed it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure that you recognized that young
fellow?&#8221; I asked as I handed him the glass, not having
seen any one on the yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d eat my sea-boots if it wasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, keep an eye skinned for her. It&#8217;s very
singular.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took his advice not to show myself and sat down
on the other side of the deck and lit a cigar to think
things over.</p>

<p>I recalled Vasco&#8217;s request for the loan of the <i>Stella</i>
and the hesitating way in which he had explained that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
he had abandoned the idea of taking his companions
for a day&#8217;s cruise.</p>

<p>Why was he on that other yacht? For a time my
mind was so thronged with the crowd of suggestions
arising out of Dagara&#8217;s statement, the events of the
last few days, and now this enigma of a crewless yacht,
that I had the greatest difficulty in picking a course.
In my present mood I was ready to see matter for
suspicion in anything, however trivial.</p>

<p>Presently Burroughs called to me. &#8220;He&#8217;s there
now, Ralph.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Vasco, sure enough. The glass showed his
features plainly; and while I was watching, two other
men came up on the deck and all three went ashore in
a launch.</p>

<p>I returned to my seat completely bewildered. I
had gained vitally important information, but had
no idea what use to make of it. Rack my wits as I
would, I couldn&#8217;t see the connecting link with Barosa&#8217;s
plans.</p>

<p>Then all suddenly a wild thought occurred to me:
far-fetched, extravagant, and grossly improbable;
but not impossible.</p>

<p>It was that an attempt was to be made on the king&#8217;s
life, and that this crewless yacht was to afford the
means of escape for the assassins.</p>

<p>Possible or impossible I could put it to the test.
It was good enough to form a working hypothesis,
and I plunged into the consideration of the steps to
take.</p>

<p>In the first place Dagara must go back to the city
with the papers and these must find their way to
Barosa.</p>

<p>I saw how to do that. I called Burroughs to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jack, I am going to take Dagara back to the city
in the launch, and I want you to go at once to my
rooms and liberate the fellow we caught last night.
It must be done cleverly. Tell Simmons to leave Foster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
in the room alone with him and then to fire a shot and
yell to Foster for help. Foster is to rush out, leaving
the door open and the way clear for the scoundrel to
get off. He must be at liberty inside an hour from now
and must have no suspicion that the thing is a plant.
Get going, man. I&#8217;ll tell you all afterwards,&#8221; I said
as he hesitated and wanted to ask questions.</p>

<p>Then I went down to Dagara to test him.</p>

<p>I should have to trust him, for his part was of the
very pith and marrow of my new plans.</p>

<small>SPY WORK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DAGARA having finished both his task and his
lunch was waiting in some concern to know
what was to come next, and he appeared relieved
when I said he was to return in the launch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you to go back,&#8221; I told him, &#8220;and act
precisely as if our meeting had never taken place.
With this exception&mdash;should any change be made in
these arrangements for the King&#8217;s arrival to-morrow
evening, let me know them and do not divulge them
to any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And about Mademoiselle Dominguez?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what about her?&#8221; I repeated, not understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;She got you to meet me to-day after sending me
word where to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, that was a fairy tale of mine. I wrote
that cipher letter. Yours has not yet reached her
brother. But it will do so very soon now, and she
will no doubt go to your house as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you get the cipher?&#8221; he asked in
blank astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind about that. The question is, will you
do exactly as I ask? I will call at M. Volheno&#8217;s
office to-morrow afternoon and you must manage to
see me and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has an appointment from four to five with M.
Franco at the latter&#8217;s bureau. If you come then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
I could see you privately without exciting any suspicion.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agreed to do this and then, having got from him his
address and the time when he would reach his house
and give the papers to Miralda, I made certain that
no one on the <i>Rampallo</i> was taking stock of our movements,
and smuggled him into the launch.</p>

<p>As soon as he had left to return to his office I sent
the men with the launch to wait at the usual landing-stage
on the quay.</p>

<p>When I reached my rooms, the little farce had been
played and Henriques had gone. I calculated that
his first step would be to deliver the letter to Vasco,
who would immediately send Miralda for the papers,
and my intention was to meet her as she left Dagara&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>It was essential that I should know to whom she
was to hand them and that person must be shadowed
from the moment they were in his or her possession.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile I had to ascertain whether
Sampayo had left the city, and to do this I sent my
servant, Bryant, a sharp fellow, with a letter for Sampayo.
I told him to say it was to be given into Sampayo&#8217;s
own hands, and if asked, he was to say it was
from Dr. Barosa.</p>

<p>I wrote one line: &#8220;Give you one more hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned with the news that Sampayo had gone.
The furniture was being removed and all the evidences
of a speedy departure were everywhere. I concluded,
therefore, that Sampayo had learnt of the failure of
his little scheme the previous night and had fled.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Burroughs and I had discussed
the spy work that had to be done. My opinion was
that the papers would be given to Inez, and if so,
the difficulties would be considerable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simmons is sharp enough to do it,&#8221; said Burroughs;
&#8220;but I should suggest that you put both him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
and your man, Bryant, on it, and let Simmons rig
himself up as a Portuguese long-shoreman.&#8221;</p>

<p>I adopted the suggestion and we sent the man out
to buy the necessary disguise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be on hand to point out the quarry,&#8221; I
said; &#8220;but the devil of it is, if she takes them to her
house we shall have the trail cut and shall need to
shadow every one who comes out. And that&#8217;s precisely
where she is most likely to take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, I&#8217;ve a great idea,&#8221; exclaimed Burroughs,
clashing his big fist on the table excitedly. &#8220;What
price my offering to ship aboard that yacht, the
<i>Rampallo</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with this sleuthing business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, but you want to know what game&#8217;s
going on on board her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, let&#8217;s stick to one thing at a
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be great though, wouldn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;d
make &#8217;em sit up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you imagine for an instant that you are not
known to belong to the <i>Stella</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think of that,&#8221; he said crestfallen, shaking
his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t think any more of it, and let&#8217;s worry
this other thing out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get that infernal boat out of my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did worry with it until it was time to set out;
but the only thing I could see to do, if Inez took the
papers home, was to call at her house myself.</p>

<p>Being entirely new to this spy business, I was abominably
nervous and possessed with the conviction that
every one we met knew quite well the reason why we
were strolling along the street with an entirely exaggerated
air of indifference.</p>

<p>Burroughs and I went ahead, Simmons, got up as
a rather theatrical Portuguese fisherman, was behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
us, and Bryant, who apparently was the coolest of
the four, followed on the opposite side of the street.</p>

<p>We had barely reached the neighbourhood of Dagara&#8217;s
house when Miralda drove up in a hired carriage.
She stopped the driver a hundred yards short of the
street and got out, leaving the driver to wait.</p>

<p>My first step was to get rid of the carriage, by telling
the man he would not be wanted and paying his fare
with the addition of a liberal tip.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Miralda returned and was profoundly
surprised to find me instead of the carriage,
and her hand trembled as she put it in mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sent your carriage away. I knew you were
coming to M. Dagara&#8217;s house and the reason, and I
was compelled to speak to you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have frightened me. What is the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am only going to ask you to trust me. You
will?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Need you ask that?&#8221; and her eyes flashed in
reproach. &#8220;But I may be seen with you,&#8221; she added,
glancing round.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to keep you long enough to explain
everything&mdash;only to ask you two questions. I will
tell you everything another time. To whom are you
going to give the papers you have just received from
M. Dagara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington!&#8221; she cried with a start and a
stare of astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not to me,&#8221; I replied with a smile. &#8220;Let us
walk on a little. You will not think I mean anything
that is not entirely to help you in asking this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I know that. But I&mdash;I can&#8217;t tell you.
Besides, I have been ordered not&mdash;not to speak to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guessed something of the sort and that&#8217;s partly
the reason why I arranged this meeting instead of coming
to your house. You generally give such things to
the Contesse Inglesia. Shall you give her these?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>Again she was startled. &#8220;But how can all this be
known to you? Do you mean others know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. But please tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How you have learnt all this, I can&#8217;t imagine; but
you are right. I do generally give them to Inez. But
there has been some unaccountable delay and I am to
give them to Vasco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good news, for a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why good news?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must let me be a little mysterious for the
present. And now, the second question&mdash;can you
tell me where he is to take them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know no more than you&mdash;not so much indeed
it seems;&#8221; and she smiled faintly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better&mdash;that you can smile, I mean. When
will you give them to him? Is he waiting at your
home for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He hurried in to tell me to fetch them at
once and that he would come back for them. He was
very excited about something and very strange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When is he to return for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must know. It is absolutely vital. Can
you so arrange that he does not get them until, say,
eight o&#8217;clock this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me. Can you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be dangerous, but I&mdash;I will try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be certain,&#8221; I said firmly. &#8220;I must know
definitely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then of course I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I shall depend on you. Let me say how
I thank you for this trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if I should not,&#8221; she said again, with a look of
reproach. &#8220;But&mdash;but can&#8217;t you tell me something?
I am all at sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we both were,&#8221; I cried impulsively. &#8220;That
would put an end to all this ugly business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Her face clouded. &#8220;I can see no end to it but
trouble and disaster,&#8221; she replied with a gesture of
despair that went to my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I can see the end, if all goes well just
now. But if I fail&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I paused and looked at her
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you fail?&#8221; she repeated questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still the sea,&#8221; I said, with as much under-current
of meaning as I could put into tone, looks,
manner.</p>

<p>She sighed. &#8220;Yes, there is still the sea; but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and she shook her head despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you dare?&#8221; I asked in little more than a
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am fettered like a slave&mdash;oh, once more to be
free!&#8221; she sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you dare it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>But at that she flinched. &#8220;I am talking like a
madwoman. It is impossible, impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand that word when I am in such
earnest as now. Sampayo has left Lisbon. I have
driven him away. I will sweep every other obstacle
out of our path. Miralda?&#8221;</p>

<p>She trembled as I uttered her name and took her
hand in mine; the colour flushed her cheeks and she
stood hesitating with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miralda?&#8221; I said again appealingly, hoping she
would yield.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, how you tempt me!&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;In less than an hour we can be out of the river,
homeward bound. For God&#8217;s sake come&mdash;now,&#8221; I said
passionately.</p>

<p>But I failed. She started as if from a dream and
shivered. &#8220;You made me forget, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember only your happiness and the freedom
from all these troubles. Trust me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, sighed deeply, and withdrew
her hand. &#8220;It is not that I distrust. But there is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
mother. If I were to play these men false they would
visit it upon her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she can come with us. Let me see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible. Impossible. Would to Heaven
it were not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll try the other way,&#8221; I said. &#8220;But if I
fail&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After a pause she lifted her eyes to mine, let them
rest there a second and then smiled, but shook her
head despondently again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be as you will,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And now there
is one thing more. It may be necessary for me to
communicate with you. If I send one of my people
to your house, will you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I will help you all I can and pray for your
success.&#8221;</p>

<p>I held out my hand. &#8220;Till we meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put hers into it with a delighting pressure.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I fail,&#8221; I said again, &#8220;there is still the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still the sea,&#8221; she whispered; &#8220;for you,
but not for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I watched her go and presently saw her enter a
carriage.</p>

<p>Then Burroughs came up and I tried to think of
other things; not very successfully at first. We
returned to my rooms, and on the way Miralda&#8217;s
eloquent smile, the thrilling pressure of her hand, the
flush of tell-tale colour, and the proof of her trust, entangled
my wits and made it difficult for me for a time
to give coherent answers to the questions of my
insistently curious companion.</p>

<p>My object in securing Miralda&#8217;s promise to delay the
delivery of the papers to Vasco was to enable me to
make preparations to follow him myself, and I set
about them the instant we reached my rooms.</p>

<p>I had decided to use the Portuguese clothes which
Simmons had obtained; and a few alterations in them
together with a false moustache, the darkening of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
eyebrows and the judicious application of a little picturesque
dirt to my face and hands and clothes, so
changed my appearance that even Miralda would have
had difficulty in recognizing me.</p>

<p>I arranged that Burroughs should follow me, to be at
hand in case of need; that Simmons should go to the
launch and Foster remain for the night with Bryant
at the flat.</p>

<p>It was dark when I reached the visconte&#8217;s house to
wait for Vasco, and I had no fear that he would penetrate
my disguise.</p>

<p>There was one trouble I had to guard against&mdash;the
danger of the streets. The fact that a man of my
apparent position was lurking about in such a neighbourhood
might easily attract the attention of the
police, but I was saved from that embarrassment by
Miralda&#8217;s punctuality.</p>

<p>I had scarcely found a hiding-place when a carriage
drove up and she and Inez alighted from it and entered
the house. She had gone to Inez in order not
to meet Vasco until the hour we had agreed.</p>

<p>Three minutes afterwards he came out and hurried
away at a rapid pace, and the spy work commenced
in earnest. While we were in the quieter streets, I
followed at just sufficient distance to keep him in
sight; but when he turned into the Rua Sao Benito
I hastened to close up, for fear of losing him in that
somewhat busy street.</p>

<p>As I hurried round the corner I nearly plumped into
him. He stood looking about him, and I stopped
and rolled a cigarette to fill the pause.</p>

<p>It turned out that he was waiting for a tram-car,
and when he boarded it I had no option but to risk
discovery and follow him. He sat close to the door
and I passed him, with my face averted, choosing a
seat on the same side, but at the other end.</p>

<p>He was in a condition of extreme nervous excitement
and had been drinking freely, probably to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
drown his fears. He sat with his hands plunged in
his pockets and took no notice of any one; and even
when the other passengers got out at the Square of
St. Paul, leaving him at one end of the long seat and
me at the other with no one between us, he took no
notice of me.</p>

<p>I had now lost Burroughs, of course. He had hung
behind until he had missed the car; but this was
perhaps all the better. If he had been in the car,
Vasco might have recognized him.</p>

<p>When we reached the Praca do Commercio, Vasco
got up and jumped off and hurried along the Rua da
Alfandega. There was little fear of my attracting
notice here as there were still plenty of people about,
and I had no difficulty in following him.</p>

<p>I guessed now that he was making for the landing-stage
near the Artillery Museum, and just as he reached
that building he was accosted by two men in the
dress of sailors. He drew back nervously at first,
with a sharp stare; then began to talk to them;
and they walked on together.</p>

<p>They were as much like sailors as I was like the
cross of St. Paul&#8217;s, and walked with the stiff upright
carriage of well-drilled soldiers.</p>

<p>It was clear that I was not the only person in Lisbon
that night with a fancy for disguise, and this discovery
confirmed my opinion that Vasco was making for the
landing-stage.</p>

<p>Were Burroughs&#8217; suspicions of that yacht, the
<i>Rampallo</i>, about to be confirmed?</p>

<p>It looked uncommonly like it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>A NIGHT ADVENTURE ON THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE fact that Vasco&#8217;s companions&mdash;presumably
his fellow-officers&mdash;were playing at being sailors,
increased the need for extreme caution. I dropped
back and followed at a distance, contented to keep the
three men just in sight.</p>

<p>They made straight for the landing-stage, got aboard
a small launch in which another man was waiting,
and cast off at once and headed out into the estuary.
They were going to the <i>Rampallo</i>, of course; and equally
of course I must manage to get on board after them.</p>

<p>I could not follow immediately, however, as the noise
of my launch would be heard and a dozen suspicions
started. I guessed that a conference was to be held
on the yacht about the information which Vasco
had brought; but why such a place was chosen for it
baffled me. The reason could not be merely the desire
for absolute privacy which had induced me to take
Dagara to the <i>Stella</i>. These men must have a dozen
places in the city where they could meet without a
remote chance of being overheard.</p>

<p>Still I had to deal with facts, and the controlling
fact now was that the papers were on Vasco and he was
going to the yacht. I must therefore follow him or
throw up the sponge.</p>

<p>While I was waiting Burroughs arrived. &#8220;I lost
you in the Rua Sao Benito, Ralph,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;so I thought it best to come on to the launch. Why
are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>I told him briefly what had occurred, and what I
meant to do, and in a few minutes we were on our
way to the <i>Stella</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking risks,&#8221; he said, as we sat talking it
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that, but in fact I&#8217;m not so sure
there are any. My idea is this. As soon as we reach
the yacht, get the <i>Firefly</i> launched.&#8221; This was a
small electric launch I had on the yacht. &#8220;You and
I will drop down in her to the <i>Rampallo</i>. She runs
with scarcely a sound, and we&#8217;ll see whether any look-out
is kept on her. I shall be surprised if there is; and if
not, I shall climb aboard without any trouble. If
there is one, you must manage to keep him watching
you at the stern while I swim to the bow and get
aboard by the anchor cable. Once on board, I&#8217;ll shift
for myself. If necessary I&#8217;ll silence him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds all right to you, perhaps,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be all right, Jack. The worst that can
happen is that I shall be discovered and have to make
a bolt of it. I suppose I can dive well enough to jump
from a yacht&#8217;s bulwarks. But even if the beggars get
hold of me, I suppose you can make enough row to scare
them. Have the launch within hail, if you like, with
the skipper and four or five of the men. There&#8217;s no
personal risk at all&mdash;the only risk is that I may fail to
find out things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they caught you they might shoot first and
jaw afterwards,&#8221; he objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dozen &#8216;ifs&#8217; suggest a dozen &#8216;mights,&#8217; of course.
But I&#8217;m not likely to give them much of a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be justified if they took you for a thief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be thinking about thieves. They&#8217;re
much more likely to be fearing the police and be scared
out of their skins. Anyway, it&#8217;s the best plan I can
think of, and it&#8217;s got to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we reached the <i>Stella</i> I threw off the clothes
I had been wearing and dressed for the venture. I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
of course to render myself as little conspicuous as
possible for the spy work on the <i>Rampallo</i>, and had
also to be careful not to wear anything which would
hamper me too much if I had to take to the water.</p>

<p>So I chose a set of very dark grey combinations which
fastened close up to the neck, and a pair of dark rubber-soled
shoes. A dark cloak to wear in the <i>Firefly</i>
completed a costume in which I looked like a cross
between a Harlequin and a Guy Fawkes conspirator.</p>

<p>By the time these preparations were complete
Burroughs had launched the <i>Firefly</i> and we were soon
off. The moon was not due for an hour and the night
was dark enough to conceal us.</p>

<p>The <i>Firefly</i> glided almost noiselessly through the
waters at the slow pace we deemed best, and we
switched off the motor every now and again and let
the boat drift. The darkness made it a little difficult
to pick up the <i>Rampallo</i>, which had no light, but
Burroughs glanced now and then at the compass by
the flash of an electric torch, and thus kept his
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;What weapon have you?&#8221; he whispered once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, none, of course. I&#8217;m not going throat-slitting.
I am only going to use my ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is,&#8221; he said suddenly, and pointed ahead.
His eyes were keener than mine, but I made her
out soon afterwards.</p>

<p>We drifted down close to her, keeping our eyes fixed
on her for any sign that a look-out was kept.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is any one on the deck,&#8221; he
whispered.</p>

<p>She was lying between us and the twinkling lamps
of the city, and as we drifted nearer, her outline showed
up against the lights and the reflexion of them in the
sky.</p>

<p>All was as still as a vault; and not a single porthole
gave out so much as the glimmer of a match.</p>

<p>A sickening feeling of disappointment began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
creep over me at the fear that there was no one on
board.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheer down alongside, Jack,&#8221; I whispered.</p>

<p>No one challenged us as we dropped under the lee
of the hull. I fended the <i>Firefly</i> off with my hands and
then worked her round under the stern.</p>

<p>Here was confirmation of my fear in the disconcerting
discovery that the launch, which I had confidently
expected to find either astern or alongside, was not
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no one on her, Ralph,&#8221; said Burroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall get aboard and see. Drop astern and then
circle round at a distance to the bow.&#8221;</p>

<p>We drifted far enough for our little propeller to be
out of earshot and then made a sweep round to the
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think it means?&#8221; he whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve backed the wrong horse. But I
can&#8217;t think of anywhere else for that launch to go.
When I get aboard stand off up the bay so that you
can keep a look-out for me. The reflection of the city
light in the sky will be enough for you to see any signal
I make to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do better than that. Take the electric
torch. You can show a light then even if you have to
swim for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a happy thought,&#8221; I exclaimed, and
tucked it inside my vest.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s any trouble I shall be able to make
racket enough for you to hear me, and you can come
aboard after me.&#8221;</p>

<p>We stopped the propeller then and drifted down till
I could reach the yacht&#8217;s cable. I swarmed up this
and, using the greatest caution, got a grip and hauled
myself up until I could see along the deck.</p>

<p>It was quite deserted, so I climbed on to the forecastle
and crept along as stealthily as a cat stalking a
bird and almost as noiselessly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>I had reached almost amidships when I discovered
that some one was on board after all. The glow from
a lamp showed through the partly open companion of
the saloon. Doubling my caution I lay at full length
on the deck and approached the opening.</p>

<p>Whoever he was he was able to afford very good
cigars, for the scent of one reached me. I lay listening
intently. I heard the crackle of papers as they were
turned over; the rustle of some one moving in his chair,
a sound of stertorous breathing; the clink of a bottle
against a glass, and again the crackle of papers as the
man, whoever he was, resumed his writing or reading.</p>

<p>For many minutes there was no other sound. Then
the man struck a match as he lit a fresh cigar, and
pushed aside the papers with a breath of relief. Then
silence for a while, broken at length by a gasp and a
snore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, you drunken young pig!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this I nearly uttered a cry of astonishment.
It was Sampayo&#8217;s voice; and in a second I understood
what had so baffled me&mdash;why the papers had been
brought to the <i>Rampallo</i>.</p>

<p>Sampayo was hiding on it from me. That removal
of his goods and all the evidences of flight which Bryant
had seen were just play-acting to mislead me
into the belief that he had bolted, and being afraid
to be seen on shore he had arranged for his associates
to come to the boat.</p>

<p>That they were coming was soon plain. Sampayo
roused the man he had spoken to; and the answer was
in Vasco&#8217;s voice, thick with drink.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on deck, you young fool, and see if there are
any signs of the launch. They ought to be here by
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave me alone,&#8221; grunted Vasco thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go myself then,&#8221; was the reply with an
oath.</p>

<p>I slipped away forward and hid myself under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
lee of the forecastle hatchway. Sampayo came out
on deck and stood smoking and listening and peering
through the darkness for the expected launch.</p>

<p>Presently, I heard the quick throb of her propeller,
and in a few minutes she reached the yacht and three
or four men, I could not distinguish the exact number,
came on board, and all went down below at once.</p>

<p>Anxious not to miss a word of what passed I hastened
along the deck to my former position, and had just
passed the hatchway leading below to the saloon when
some one came running up the companion way.</p>

<p>In a second I rolled into the scuppers lying as still
as death.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fastened her all right,&#8221; protested some one.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, make sure. You&#8217;re not much
of a hand at sailors&#8217; knots,&#8221; was the laughing reply.</p>

<p>Two men came out and hurried across the deck.
One of them got down into the launch; and the other
stood watching.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right. As fast as a steeple.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a pretty mess if she got adrift.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men came on deck again and they both returned
toward the companion way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose everything&#8217;s all right on the deck,&#8221; said
one.</p>

<p>&#8220;What should be wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Only I&#8217;ve got an infernally uneasy
feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not going to back out at the last minute, are you?
We shall be in a pretty bad way to-morrow night if we
have to go without the only man who knows anything
about managing the boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who said anything about backing out? We&#8217;re
all in it now, sink or swim. But&mdash;oh, hang presentiments,&#8221;
he broke off irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get a lantern if you like and look round
the deck. But it&#8217;s all rot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve half a mind you shall.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>As he said this he came a couple of paces toward
me, and I began to think any number of unpleasant
things.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be a minute,&#8221; said the other and ran down
below.</p>

<p>Move I dare not. The man was too close to me,
and the instant the other returned with a light, my
discovery was certain. All I could do was to plan
how to escape. I decided to lie still until actually
discovered, and then trust to their astonishment,
giving me time to jump over the side and swim for
it.</p>

<p>The few seconds that followed were among the
longest of my life. But just as I heard the second man
coming with the lantern, some one below called to the
man close to me by name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gompez!&#8221;</p>

<p>He went a couple of steps down the companion way
and replied that he was going to see that all was snug
on deck, and before the words were out of his mouth
I was half-way to the stern.</p>

<p>Then followed the grimmest game of hide and seek
I have ever had to play. But the odds were on my
side. The two men went carefully round the deck;
but, fool-like, kept together. The light of the lantern
showed me exactly where they were all the time,
and by skulking from cover to cover I had little
difficulty in keeping out of their way.</p>

<p>My movements were absolutely noiseless, and the
dark grey costume I had fortunately put on made it
almost impossible for them to see me.</p>

<p>I had one other narrow escape. I had worked my
way back again to the companion while they were in
the bows, when another man came out and called to
them sharply to be quick. I was crouched so close to
him that he could have touched me if he had stretched
out a hand in my direction.</p>

<p>But instead of that he went a few steps toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
others and I turned and slipped away in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later the three went below,
the newcomer expressing a strong opinion about the
folly of having shown a light.</p>

<p>Giving them time to join the rest of the party below,
I crawled back to the companion and settled myself to
listen once more.</p>

<p>Barosa&#8217;s was the first voice I heard distinctly.
&#8220;We needn&#8217;t waste any more time in discussing it.
Captain Gompez was quite right to satisfy himself
and as we are indebted to him for having the boat at
all, it is surely ungracious to charge him with wasting
a few minutes for this purpose. And now, please,
will you let me explain exactly what are the arrangements
for to-morrow? Major Sampayo has carefully
examined these papers, and every detail is as I told
you it would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a murmur of interest, followed by a pause,
and then Barosa spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have news of the greatest importance for you,
gentlemen, and that you may appreciate it fully, I shall
be obliged if you will carefully study this plan of the
scene.&#8221;</p>

<p>A considerable rustling of papers followed as the
plans were handed round, the whispering of many
questions, and then another pause of silent, almost
breathless expectancy.</p>

<small>PLOT AND COUNTERPLOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE pause was a long one before Barosa spoke
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we have all studied the actual ground of
which these are the plans, but it was best that we should
have them before us in settling the final details. I was
able to tell you three days ago the arrangements for
Dom Carlos&#8217;s private visit to the city to-morrow
evening, and this later information, coming straight
from M. Volheno&#8217;s office, confirms them. Dom Carlos
will arrive at the little Eastern landing-stage at a few
minutes before eight, and will have with him two
companions&mdash;only two. And the news I have for you
is that those two companions are fast and firm adherents
of the rightful king of Portugal, His Majesty
Dom Miguel.&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise greeted this statement, and
Barosa paused in evident enjoyment of the effect his
words had produced.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are Conte Carvalho Listoa and Colonel
Antonio Castillo. You will agree that I do not exaggerate
when I say that that fact makes failure impossible.
He will be received by six officers of the 7th
Battalion of the Royal Guards&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; and he gave a
string of names which I do not remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;These, as we know well, are also our staunch friends,
pledged like ourselves to give their lives for their rightful
king. Dom Carlos will thus be without a single
supporter, and absolutely in our power. He has, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
you know, made use of the same landing-stage on the
occasion of former private visits to the city, and the
arrangement has always been that a carriage drew up
close to the stage. That will not be practicable to-morrow,
although he does not know it. You will see
two thin red lines on the plans. Those indicate the
lines of excavations, which have been made for some
supposed building and drainage operations. I have
been able to get that work started without creating
any suspicion as to the real object&mdash;which is to render
it impossible for a carriage to approach within fifty
yards of the landing-stage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; exclaimed some one and the others murmured
assent.</p>

<p>Barosa then explained the scheme in elaborate detail.</p>

<p>It was this. The king was to be met at the landing-stage
and the officers were to explain why the carriage
was not in the usual place; and that it was in waiting
for him at a spot most easily reached through the smaller
of two sheds used for wharfage purposes. A door at
the back of this shed opened on to a narrow way
between two buildings. The officers were not to leave
the shed, as it was deemed desirable that they should
not take any personal part in what followed. The two
friends of the king were to walk a few yards with
him and then excuse themselves on the plea that they
had left something on the launch, but if this proved
impracticable, they were to drop behind.</p>

<p>From the door of the shed to the end of the passage
was a distance of some forty yards and a carriage was
to be in full view; but this was to be one provided by
Barosa and intended for the escape of those in the plot
who would not be needed after the attempt had been
carried out. The king&#8217;s carriage, sent from the Palace,
was to wait at a spot fifty yards in the other direction.</p>

<p>Except the two servants with Barosa&#8217;s carriage, not
a man was to show himself in the path between the
shed door and the carriage, lest the king&#8217;s suspicions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
should be roused. The coachman was to signal with
his whip when the king appeared, and then to make it
appear that the horses were restive and to back them
past the corner of the building on the left hand of the
narrow passage.</p>

<p>Round this corner the conspirators were to wait
and when the king reached it, a cloak was to be thrown
over his head and he was to be gagged and hurried
through an adjoining shed to some water steps where
the launch would be waiting to rush him to the <i>Rampallo</i>,
where a cabin had been specially prepared for
him. The yacht was to make at full steam for Oporto,
where he was to be delivered over to the revolutionary
party there and forced, under threat of assassination,
to abdicate in favour of Dom Miguel.</p>

<p>After Barosa had finished his explanation, a long
discussion followed on many of the details. The scheme
was hailed with approval, but the tone of the speakers
convinced me that, while ready to take part in an
abduction plot, they were against assassination, and
Barosa had to give very specific assurances that nothing
of the sort would be attempted.</p>

<p>Presently the talk turned upon the arrangements
made to protect themselves and their friends when the
trouble came after the abduction; and as it was not
very material for me to learn that, I crept away to the
bow, lowered myself noiselessly into the water, flashed
my torchlamp as a signal to Burroughs, and struck out
to meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve given me the fright of my life, Ralph,&#8221; he
said when I had clambered into the <i>Firefly</i>. &#8220;I heard
their launch come out, and saw a light moving about
the deck and didn&#8217;t know what the deuce to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Jack. Get back to the <i>Stella</i>.
I&#8217;m cold to the bones, but I&#8217;ve heard enough to keep
my blood from stagnating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s my flask. Take a pull.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gulped down a couple of mouthfuls of whisky, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
as soon as I was on board and had had a hot bath, a
vigorous towelling, and some grog, I was ready to talk
things over with him.</p>

<p>I told him everything I had overheard. &#8220;And now
the question is what I&#8217;m to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as simple as falling off a tree. Slip off to the
quay and bring off a party of police and take &#8217;em on the
yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and get the only woman in the world I care
for arrested for conspiracy in a plot to abduct the
king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could make her safety a condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With whom? Who&#8217;s to assure me of that?
It&#8217;s nearly midnight. Where do you suppose these
men would be by the time I had roused first Volheno
and then old Franco the Dictator, and argued the
matter out. And if they refused, where should I find
myself? I can tell you. In gaol until I opened my
lips. I&#8217;m already half-suspect as it is. That saw
won&#8217;t cut any ice, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t let the thing go through, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the King of Portugal to me, and what do I
care whether his name&#8217;s Carlos or Miguel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, tell mademoiselle what&#8217;s going on and
get her to make a bolt of it on the <i>Stella</i> to-morrow,
and leave word behind you and queer the plan that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several reasons against that, but one&#8217;s
enough. She wouldn&#8217;t leave her mother to bear the
brunt of things, her brother&#8217;s up to the eyes in it,
and if she did bolt, she&#8217;d be under the charge all her life
long and her flight would be accepted as proof of guilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I give it up then,&#8221; he exclaimed with a
shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve got to queer the thing
somehow and make certain of mademoiselle&#8217;s safety.
And I&#8217;ve got to do it off my own bat. Wait a bit, wait
a bit,&#8221; I exclaimed after some minutes&#8217; thought.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got an idea coming. By the lord-knows-who,
I believe it would be possible. Let&#8217;s go over that
business again. He lands from the launch, goes into
the shed&mdash;there are two sheds, I remember&mdash;he goes
out with his two friends, the coachman sees him and
under pretence of the horses turning restive, backs the
carriage past the corner, the two friends turn back.
I wonder if both sheds have doors at the back. I
expect so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Greek you&#8217;re muttering?&#8221; broke in Burroughs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand up, Jack, let&#8217;s have a look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up and I laughed as I looked him over.
&#8220;Wait a bit, take your coat off,&#8221; and I plunged into
my cabin and fished out a thick tweed shooting coat
and a soft felt hat. &#8220;Here, put these on, quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did so, muttering: &#8220;Is this a pantomime rehearsal?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the lord Harry, it&#8217;ll do,&#8221; I cried excitedly,
smacking my hands together.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait, man, wait. It&#8217;s all coming up like a clear
photo. How much taller am I of us two? By George,
two inches. That&#8217;s a heap; but padding might take
off some of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;d like to know how much thinner
you are than I am next?&#8221; he said with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I would,&#8221; I replied to his still
greater surprise. &#8220;Six inches, eh. That&#8217;s a lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And muscle too, not fat, mind that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I can get over that, easily enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;ve a minute to spare perhaps you&#8217;ll tell
me why you take this sudden interest in my anatomy?&#8221;
he asked drily, as he threw off my shooting coat and
put on his jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to crown you and be your Majesty&#8217;s
understudy at the same time, King Jack Burroughs.
You won&#8217;t have a long reign, my boy&mdash;only a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
of minutes at most&mdash;that is if that second shed has
the door I believe it has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon be understudying in a strait jacket
at this rate, Ralph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a little mad, perhaps, but I&#8217;m going to do
it. I intend you to take the place of the king to-morrow
evening long enough for this coachman to
mistake you for him. I shall then take your place,
the instant no one is looking, and I&#8217;m going to let
these men abduct me. It will be much easier for them
than if they got hold of the genuine article.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be much simpler and shorter to put
a bullet in your head yourself?&#8221; he asked grimly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll find one get there all right when they know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. You forget the &#8216;divinity that
doth hedge a king.&#8217; These men are not assassins.
They made that plain; nor are they accustomed to
handle kings every day. They&#8217;ll be so excited over the
business that they&#8217;ll be as nervous about ill-treating
him as an old maid about her lap dog. They&#8217;re
officers, mind, and what we term gentlemen; and
they&#8217;ll be so scared to death lest the thing is going to
fail, that they won&#8217;t want me to have so much as a
peep at their faces until I&#8217;m safe on the <i>Rampallo</i>
and locked up in the cabin which, as I heard, is already
in readiness for my reception. If you turn the thing
over, you&#8217;ll see that if I had laid the plan myself, it
could not have suited me better;&#8221; and I ran over it
again in detail.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we first leave the shed you&#8217;ll be king, and
Bryant&mdash;I shall use Bryant because he&#8217;s a cool hand&mdash;and
I will be in attendance on your Majesty. You&#8217;ll
be recognized at once as the king&mdash;half Lisbon would
mistake you for him at close grips even, and these
fellows will be expecting you&mdash;we shall walk about
ten yards and then stop while we are supposed to be
asking you to excuse us; and we shan&#8217;t move on until
the carriage has backed out of sight. I shall then take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
your place&mdash;I shall pad myself out, you know, and
make up&mdash;and shall walk on alone straight into the
trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why you? I could put up a bigger fight
than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no fight to be put up at all, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to let them carry you off to Oporto?
You may find yourself in a tighter corner there than
you reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to Oporto. It&#8217;s 180 miles or
thereabouts and, with an amateur crew, the <i>Rampallo</i>
under the best circumstances wouldn&#8217;t make more than
twelve to fifteen knots; the <i>Stella</i> would steam round
her, and from the moment these beggars shove their
yacht&#8217;s nose out of the harbour, you&#8217;ll keep almost
within hailing distance. That&#8217;s where I want you.
They&#8217;ll shut me into the cabin and as soon as it&#8217;s
daylight I&#8217;ll hang a handkerchief or a pillow-case or
something out of the porthole, and you&#8217;ll make trouble
for my hosts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they&#8217;ll stop directly and say &#8216;thank
you, sir,&#8217; and go down on their knees and ask me to come
on board and kick &#8217;em,&#8221; he gibed with a heave of his
big shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what they say, it&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll
do, Jack. Haven&#8217;t we got a couple of guns? And
couldn&#8217;t you give the thing a pretty loud advertisement?
And do you think they&#8217;ll relish to have you firing a
royal salute within a league or so of the shore? And
can&#8217;t we get some cartridges that aren&#8217;t blank in the
city to-morrow? And would they enjoy their breakfast
nicely if you sent a shot into the <i>Rampallo&#8217;s</i> hull?
Or couldn&#8217;t the old man run the <i>Stella</i> alongside in
the old grappling-iron style?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Piracy now, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, piracy, if it comes to it. But it won&#8217;t. What
I&#8217;m after is this. Sign on an extra crew to-morrow
and get &#8217;em on the <i>Stella</i> quietly. When you see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
my signal, sheer close up, fire a blank cartridge and
order them to stop. Get our men aboard somehow
or anyhow; and then we&#8217;ll send the <i>Rampallo</i> off to
sea with the whole of them in her as prisoners and keep
them away a week. By that time I shall have had time
to straighten things out in the city. And now I&#8217;ll tell
you exactly what we&#8217;ve got to do to-morrow;&#8221; and I
went very carefully over the whole ground, filling in
the gaps and elaborating the details and mapping out
the whole of the day&#8217;s work before us.</p>

<p>As soon as the dawn broke, Burroughs and I steamed
over to the Eastern landing-stage and made a careful
survey of the scene of operations. There were half a
dozen places where we could lie hidden in the larger
shed, and as I had hoped, it had an opening at the
back, and the doors were so close together that it
would be difficult for any one at the spot where the
carriage was to remain to be certain which one a person
leaving either would use.</p>

<p>I explained everything as I had planned it; and
as we ran back to the <i>Stella</i> to snatch three or four
hours&#8217; sleep, I arranged that Burroughs should take
Bryant down to the place during the day and explain
things to him.</p>

<p>As soon as we were up, the skipper was called to a
consultation and his work assigned to him. He was
to engage the spare crew, buy some ball cartridges
and half a dozen pair of handcuffs, and lay in a store of
provisions to put on the <i>Rampallo</i> sufficient for a
week&#8217;s cruise, if the scheme went right.</p>

<p>With Burroughs I went to my rooms and we explained
Bryant&#8217;s part to him and sent him off to
get the necessary disguises&mdash;shooting rigs such as
were in common enough use, and three light dustcoats
for us to wear over the disguises in driving to the
landing-stage. For me he was also to get some padding
to fill out my spare figure to something like the
proportions of His Majesty, and a quantity of small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
shot, intended to increase my weight, lest my abductors
should detect the deception when they found I was
two or three stone lighter than their august and portly
monarch ought to be.</p>

<p>The arrangements of these matters occupied nearly
all the morning.</p>

<p>Next, I sent Burroughs to Miralda to tell her to find
some means of preventing Vasco from taking any part
in the night&#8217;s work. If necessary Burroughs was to
frighten her into compliance, but not to say what was
actually on foot. If no other way could be found,
Miralda was to drug Vasco. But by fair means or foul,
he must be prevented from leaving the house, or his
life would be in danger.</p>

<p>This was essential in view of the line I meant to
take with Volheno and the authorities in the event of
success.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>READY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS busy with the final touches to my shooting
rig when Burroughs returned bringing Miralda&#8217;s
promise to do what I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is going to stop him somehow, Ralph. I
think she&#8217;ll drug him if he gives any trouble. He
was evidently gloriously drunk last night and he
turned up this morning&mdash;his friends of the <i>Rampallo</i>
took him back&mdash;and is all to pieces, she told me. He
had already let out enough to scare her out of her
senses almost, and she jumped at the chance of saving
him from trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she want to know things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think? She has a way with her,
too; and I was glad to get out of fire of her eyes&mdash;or
she&#8217;d have had the whole business out of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any message for me?&#8221; I asked casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing particular, of course,&#8221; he replied in
the same tone, with a grin. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder you&#8217;re
willing to do things now. Hanged if I wouldn&#8217;t be.
She wanted to know that you weren&#8217;t running any risks;
but she didn&#8217;t seem to fancy that a rough sort of
sea-dog like me was the sort of message carrier she
ought to choose, so she made a postman of me;&#8221;
and he put down a letter and went out of the room
saying he wanted to tell Simmons something.</p>

<p>It was the first letter I had ever received from
Miralda, and I did what I suppose nine out of ten
mooncalves would have done. I just sat staring at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
the envelope for a while, as if it were an amulet with
a thousand mystic virtues, and looking round to
make sure I was alone, I kissed it&mdash;yes, and more
than once, before I thought of such a commonplace
thing as opening it.</p>

<p>It was very simply worded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;I will of course do what you ask; and I think
I am half disappointed you have asked so little of me&mdash;a
something to help others, not you yourself. Your
friend&#8217;s manner shows me that he at any rate recognizes
the dangers of the task you are attempting, whatever
that may be. I know it would be useless to try and
dissuade you from it; and I suppose I cannot help
you. But I can pray for you. With all my heart
and soul I do. God keep you safe and unharmed, and
give you success.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Miralda.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult even to suggest how this letter moved
me.</p>

<p>Like a pause of peace and hope and love in the midst
of the strenuous hurly-burly of the struggle, it seemed;
a favour on the lance of a knight setting out to battle
for the woman of his heart; a kiss imprinted on the
shield with love&#8217;s whispered blessing. For the moment
all else in the world was nothing, and Miralda was all
in all. Everything was forgotten as my thoughts
wandered among the fairy groves of that mystic domain
of ecstatic oblivion&mdash;the rhapsody of a lover who
knows that he may hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I sew these shot pads together, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Bryant&#8217;s respectful voice, and it brought
me to earth as if I had dropped from a balloon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? Oh. Yes. No. I&#8217;ll see to it in a moment,&#8221;
I muttered incoherently, as my thoughts were knitting
themselves together. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Bryant;&#8221; and
with an effort I told him what I wished and sent him
away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>The dream was broken, but I folded Miralda&#8217;s
letter and was putting it next my heart, when common
sense prevailed over romance. I might fail. If I
did and were searched, the letter, instead of an amulet
protecting me from danger, might prove a serious
peril for her. So I lit a match, and kissed the paper
once more, and burnt it.</p>

<p>Then Burroughs returned to discuss where we had
better have the launch in waiting for him to get back
to the <i>Stella</i>. This proved to be, however, only the
preface to a change he wished to make in the plan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to think that you&#8217;ll be in any
danger while you&#8217;re in the hands of these fellows on
the <i>Rampallo</i>, Ralph?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I shall take a revolver with me, of course.
There&#8217;ll be plenty of chance of concealing it under
all that padding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve thought of something. When the time
comes for us to hail their boat in the morning, it would
give them a much bigger scare if it was you who hailed
them. I&#8217;m afraid of that part of the business, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with such earnestness that he showed his
meaning at once. &#8220;Why not say it plump out, Jack?&#8221;
I asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you, don&#8217;t you understand? That part
of the affair will need a longer head than mine to
manage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I do understand is that you don&#8217;t agree
with me about there being no danger for the prisoner
on the <i>Rampallo</i> and that you want to be the prisoner
instead of me. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s like your infernal
conceit to want to cast yourself for the star part?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come off,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;There&#8217;s no earthly
good in your keeping the star part for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you give me the cheering opinion that I
should find a bullet in my head when they discovered
me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious, Ralph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, answer me this. If I&#8217;m right and there
is no danger, I run no risk. And if you&#8217;re right and
there is danger, why should I shove you into it instead
of myself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty reasons. If anything happened to you
the whole thing would be spoilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. We should still have wrecked
this little revolutionary move and you could carry
out the rest of the plan with the much stronger card that
these beggars would have to answer for what they
might have done to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but hang it all, man, there&#8217;s&mdash;there&#8217;s the girl,&#8221;
he said, hesitatingly and almost nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to make me jealous, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rot, Ralph. I&#8217;m in earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The offer is just what I should expect from you,
but I must see the thing through myself. If there
is any risk, it must be mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Jack,&#8221; I interposed, shaking my head. His
offer moved me deeply. It was just like his whole-hearted
friendship to wish to take the risk, especially as
he believed it to be much more serious than I did.
Big or little, however, that risk must be mine. But
his disappointment was both genuine and keen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go out now,&#8221; I said a moment later. &#8220;I
have to see Dagara, and while I&#8217;m away, you&#8217;d better
take Bryant down to the landing-stage and put him
through his paces.&#8221;</p>

<p>He got up with a smile and a heave of his broad
shoulders. &#8220;You&#8217;re an obstinate devil, Ralph,&#8221;
he said: &#8220;and it would serve you right if I chucked
the whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here. I&#8217;ll put it another way. If our
positions were reversed, would you let me take the
star part?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any of your conundrums,&#8221; he grunted,
and went off to call Bryant.</p>

<p>Acting on my resolve to avoid even remote risks, I
took Simmons with me to M. Volheno&#8217;s bureau.</p>

<p>I found Dagara on the look-out for me, and the
moment I asked for M. Volheno, he came out of an
adjoining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. Volheno is not in, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; he said, for
the benefit of the clerks round. &#8220;Can I be of any
assistance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wished to ask a simple question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you come into my room?&#8221; and he led the
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? Have you any further information for
me?&#8221; I asked as soon as he had closed the door carefully
behind us.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no change in the arrangements for His
Majesty&#8217;s arrival to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None whatever, but&mdash;but I want to speak to
you. I can&#8217;t bear this any longer. I have decided
to tell M. Volheno everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he did anything of the sort, of course there was
an end to all my plans, and therefore to all my hopes
of getting Miralda out of the trouble. But it would
not do to let him see it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are quite right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was as much surprised as I intended him to be.
&#8220;I scarcely expected you to agree so readily. But
after my promise to you, I felt I must let you know
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not involved, M. Dagara. You are in a very
trying position&mdash;purgatory, as you term it&mdash;but your
ruin and imprisonment cannot in any way affect any one
but yourself and your wife and children, of
course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife and children?&#8221; he echoed blankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not your children, perhaps. Your friends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
will no doubt be able to take care of them. Your
wife, only, I should have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she has had nothing to do with this betrayal
of information.&#8221;</p>

<p>I perceived then that he had not decided to confess,
but was only contemplating the step. &#8220;You are
rather shortsighted, surely, if you think that those
whom you are going to give up to justice will not
retaliate. You must reckon that they will do their
utmost to be revenged, and that utmost will include
your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think I should confess, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I think you should have told
everything long ago; but you might have taken the
precaution of sending your wife out of the country.
Is she strong enough to bear imprisonment? You
know what hells your Portuguese prisons are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would kill her in a week,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is clearly your duty, but I am sorry for
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the means to send her away. O God,
I&#8217;d kill myself if I dared, but that would only leave
her destitute and at the mercy of the men who have
destroyed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have destroyed yourself,&#8221; I said sternly.
&#8220;But I have no time to discuss this with you. So
far as I am concerned, I prefer that you include every
detail of our interview yesterday in your confession
to M. Volheno. Hide nothing, for I have nothing
to fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having made him believe that I was indifferent, I
rose and turned to the door, and then paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I have quite understood one thing
you said&mdash;about not having means to send your wife
away. Does that mean that you have no money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied disconsolately. &#8220;My salary is
not large and I cannot save.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if that&#8217;s all, you must allow my pity for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
wife and children to take a practical shape. How
much money would she require?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said, wringing his hands
fatuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Try and think it out, then;&#8221; and while he was
doing this I turned my side of the matter over and
came to the conclusion that as his presence was a
menace to Miralda&#8217;s safety, the sooner he was out of
Lisbon the better. The moment this abduction plot
failed, a dozen informers were certain to offer evidence,
and he and his wife would certainly be accused.</p>

<p>&#8220;About two hundred and fifty milreis, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said, looking up at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you asked my advice just now, and I&#8217;ll give
it you. You are ill both in mind and body. Any
one can see that, and in such a condition, no one can
form a calm judgment. Ask M. Volheno to give you
a fortnight&#8217;s holiday and leave the country to-night.
I will give you double the sum you ask for now. Go
to Paris and give your address to M. Madrillo, at the
Spanish Embassy. He will let me know it and I will
send you another two hundred and fifty milreis, and
will let you know the position here.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put the money on the table and the tears were
in his eyes as he seized my hand and pressed it in both
of his.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give way, man. If I find that it is not
safe for you to return here, I will interest myself to
find you employment either in Paris or elsewhere.
Don&#8217;t thank me, but prove your gratitude by going
straight for the future;&#8221; and I hurried away. It was
worth many times the money to secure the delay for
Miralda, and his excessive gratitude tended to make
me feel rather mean.</p>

<p>Burroughs and Bryant had not returned when I
reached my rooms, so I went once more carefully
over every detail of my scheme in a kind of mental
rehearsal. There was only one point which gave me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
any qualms now. We three had to get into the shed
on the wharf without being seen and conceal ourselves,
and yet be able to learn the precise moment of the
king&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>Burroughs had been worrying over the same thing,
it turned out, and had not been idle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve made a useful friend, Ralph,&#8221; he said when
he arrived. &#8220;Got hold of the wharf watchman.
He&#8217;s a Spaniard, and Bryant&#8217;s Spanish came in very
handy. He managed to find out how things go down
there. He shuts the big shed at seven o&#8217;clock and
we must be inside before then. We can manage it all
right. That Bryant has his head screwed on the
right way. He promised to go to the man&#8217;s house to-night
at nine o&#8217;clock; so that if we show up about
half-past six, he&#8217;s going to meet him and take him
away while he explains why he can&#8217;t keep the appointment.
We shall slip in then, and Bryant will get
rid of him and join us by the back entrance. A screwdriver
will do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A screwdriver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a good look at the lock on that back door
and five minutes will have it off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been worrying about that part of the thing.
But time&#8217;s getting on. We&#8217;d better have something
to eat and get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The business of dressing occupied some time. We
all wore the hunting rigs over our ordinary clothes;
as both Burroughs and Bryant were to get rid of theirs
as soon as possible after the purpose for which they
were needed was achieved.</p>

<p>We sent Simmons and Foster off to the yacht and
locked the flat up for the night.</p>

<p>We looked rather like three squat square Dutchmen
as we set off; but the long grey dustcoats rendered
us sufficiently inconspicuous, and as the weather
had changed and the light was bad, we attracted no
attention in the streets.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The wind was rising and a light rain falling, and
there was every promise of a somewhat dirty night.
This was all the better for our purpose.</p>

<p>When we were near the landing-stage, Bryant went
on ahead in search of the new friend he had made and
presently we saw the two together close to the sheds.
They stood talking for a few minutes and then walked
away, and disappeared round the end of the further
building.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lives over that way,&#8221; said Burroughs. &#8220;We
may safely go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rain was falling fast now and the wind coming
in gusty squalls across the bay and not a soul was to
be seen as we slipped into the shed.</p>

<p>We hid ourselves among a large quantity of hay, and
were scarcely settled when some one else entered the
shed, and I heard him clamber among some big packing
cases. I jumped to the conclusion that either we had
been seen or that Volheno had decided to put a police
agent on the watch.</p>

<p>I dared not speak to Burroughs, and in this trying
uncertainty we waited until the watchman entered,
gave a casual glance round with his lantern, and then
locked the doors.</p>

<p>I racked my wits to know what to do about the
unwelcome interloper. Bryant might come to the
back entrance at any minute, and we should be
instantly discovered.</p>

<p>Then to my profound relief I heard his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you there, sir?&#8221; he asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Phew, how that shook me up!&#8221; exclaimed Burroughs.
&#8220;How did you get in, Bryant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got rid of the man at his house door as he was
going to fetch his overalls, so I came on at once, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But I wish you had said who you were.
Get to work with that lock.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes all was ready and we waited
anxiously for the sound of the king&#8217;s approach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>We heard the arrival of the officers in the adjoining
shed and could even catch the low hum of their voices.</p>

<p>The suspense was not a little trying; and I was
intensely glad when the whistle of a launch announced
that the king was coming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>ON THE <i>RAMPALLO</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHENEVER I read of an actor playing for the
first time a part which is to make or mar his
reputation, my thoughts fly back to that wet squally
evening on the Lisbon water-front. The big warehouse
with its piles of varied merchandise; the
curiously composite smell with its predominating
scent of hay; the creaking of the tall slide doors at the
front as the wind dashed at them and whistled through
the crevices and whispered and rustled in the cavernous
gloom of the building, the hiss and spume of the
waters of the bay, and Burroughs, Bryant and I
grouped together by the smaller door as I stood listening
intently for the cue to &#8220;go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was, and yet was not, nervous. That is, I was sure
of myself and confident of success, was quite cool, and
had not a thought of shrinking from the scene to be
played; but at the same time my pulses were beating
very fast, my tongue was dry, and I kept moistening
my lips and biting them, and I could not keep my
hands still nor my fingers from fidgetting, and I am
sure I was very pale.</p>

<p>I knew that success or failure might turn upon my
giving the signal to leave the shed at exactly the right
moment. If I went too soon, the men waiting at the
end of the narrow passage would know the king had
not had time to pass through the shed from the
launch. If I delayed too long, the king himself
might come out before the &#8220;abduction&#8221; had taken
place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>Yet I had nothing to guide me. After the whistle
of the launch we could not hear a sound to indicate
what was passing&mdash;the racket of the wind made that
impossible. Had I foreseen this, I saw how simply
I could have avoided this perplexity. A hole or two
bored in the big gates or a brick loosened in the partition
wall between the two sheds would have sufficed;
and I cursed my stupidity in having lost sight of the
precaution.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hear anything?&#8221; I whispered to Burroughs,
but both he and Bryant were in the same
dismayed perplexity as I.</p>

<p>&#8220;There seems a hitch somewhere,&#8221; he whispered
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I shan&#8217;t wait any longer,&#8221; I decided a moment
later, and I opened the door with as little noise as
possible.</p>

<p>It creaked horribly on the hinges, however, and
jammed half-way, and I caught my breath, fearing
that the wrench I had to give it must surely be heard
by those in the adjoining shed. Then the wind came
rushing through with most disconcerting violence;
and I only just succeeded in preventing the door from
slamming to with a tell-tale bang.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bold face on it, and we shall soon know,&#8221; I said
as we started through the drenching rain squall.</p>

<p>Burroughs went in front with Bryant close to his
side, while I kept behind as I did not wish the man
who was on the look-out to see that there were two
replicas of the king&#8217;s august person.</p>

<p>The rain gave us invaluable help, for it rendered
impossible any exact recognition of us by the man on
the watch.</p>

<p>We walked some ten yards along the narrow passage
before he even saw us. Then he waved his whip,
jerked at his horses, and began to back them past the
end of the building to our left.</p>

<p>At that moment the strenuous excitement was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
relieved by a touch of the ludicrous. In the preoccupation
of the period of suspense I had forgotten
to stick on the false moustache without which any
imposture would have been instantly detected.</p>

<p>I called to the others to halt a moment, and fishing
the thing out of my pocket I dabbed it on, and had
to hold it in its place by crinkling my upper lip against
my nose.</p>

<p>Burroughs and Bryant turned back; and I pulled
my felt hat well down over my face, held my head
down as if to avoid the pelting rain and hurried on
alone.</p>

<p>On reaching the corner I purposely quickened my
pace, and as I turned, something was thrown over
my head, a hand was clapped to my mouth&mdash;outside
the cloak fortunately, otherwise it might have been
my moustache only which would have been abducted&mdash;and
I was lifted off my feet and carried bodily
away.</p>

<p>I made a pretence of struggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm will happen to you unless you resist or
try to cry out,&#8221; said a voice sternly.</p>

<p>I felt I could safely desist, therefore, and let them
carry me the rest of the distance to the launch, where
I was placed in the little deckhouse with a couple of
men to hold me down.</p>

<p>I made another feeble struggle then, and once more
I was ordered with threats to lie still.</p>

<p>In the struggle I managed to get my hands up to
my face and luckily found the moustache which I
stuck on again.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards, I was turned face
downwards, and the covering cloak or cloth or whatever
it was, was pulled back sufficiently to allow of
a revolver being thrust against my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you dare even to look round, I shall fire,&#8221; said
the same voice, and I replied with an appropriate
shiver of fear. I chuckled as I realized that the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
were as anxious I should not see their faces as I was
that they should not see mine.</p>

<p>Next I felt a hand on my forehead, my face was lifted
an inch or two, and a thick wide scarf, in which a gag
was fastened, was wound twice round my head and
fastened at the back, and then my hands were tied
behind me.</p>

<p>It was extremely uncomfortable, of course, and I
had great difficulty in breathing, but that was all.
A very small discount from the success which I had
scored.</p>

<p>After that I was left to my own meditations, and
I guessed that I was not one whit less excited or ill at
ease than my captors. My one qualm was whether
the scarf would be taken off before I was left in the
cabin which was in readiness for me on the <i>Rampallo</i>.
If it was, then the confounded moustache would
assuredly go with it and that farcical incident might
prove to be the curtain raiser to a very serious drama
and possibly a tragedy.</p>

<p>But the men&#8217;s unwillingness to let me see their faces
was a fact of auspicious promise, and I judged that
their reluctance would not lessen until they were
practically certain their desperate venture had succeeded.
So long as failure was a possible contingency,
it would be practicable for them to make a bolt of it
in a body, with much less risk of recognition than if
&#8220;His Majesty&#8221; had seen that his abductors were
officers whom he knew well by sight and probably by
name.</p>

<p>Nor could they be absolutely certain of success until
the <i>Rampallo</i> was many knots on her way to Oporto.
They would naturally calculate that the abduction
would be discovered almost at once; and were no
doubt afraid that the authorities would be roused to
prompt and energetic action, with the result that the
yacht might be stopped before she could get out of
the river.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>I persuaded myself, therefore, that the risk of my
impersonation being detected was over for some hours
at least, and as this was the most comforting thought
for me, there was no good purpose to be gained by
anticipating trouble.</p>

<p>The launch was a vile sea boat. She kicked about
and tossed and pitched like the ill-behaved cockle-shell
she was, and, as I was powerless to help myself, I
rolled about the floor like a bale of goods or a very
intoxicated monarch; and the man in charge understood
neither how to manage her properly nor how
to make matters easier for his &#8220;king.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was heartily glad, therefore, when we bumped
alongside the <i>Rampallo</i> and I was hoisted aboard.
They handled me with all the clumsiness of nervous
amateurs, and I think that was the moment of my
greatest peril, for the launch danced and bobbed
about so much that they nearly dropped me into
the river.</p>

<p>But they did not unfasten the scarf, and I was
taken below into a cabin, laid on the berth, my hands
still tied and the gag in position, and locked in.</p>

<p>Had they peeped in a few minutes later they would
have been considerably surprised. They were as great
bunglers in tying my hands as they were in managing
the launch, and I had not the least difficulty in wriggling
my arms free. A vigorous tug tore off the head-gear,
wig, and all, and as there were a couple of
serviceable bolts on the door I shot them home softly,
and indulged in the luxury of unimpeded breathing.
It had not occurred to them apparently, that
&#8220;His Majesty&#8221; might be quite as anxious to keep
them out of the cabin as they were to keep him in;
otherwise they would have removed the door fastenings.</p>

<p>Then I closed the porthole and covered it over,
took off the shot-weighed shooting rig, and with
my revolver ready at hand, I threw myself at full
length on the bunk to cool and wait for the next act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>I was in darkness, of course, but by feeling the hands
of my watch I found the time to be just nine o&#8217;clock.
It would be dawn between four and five; and I had
thus some seven or eight hours to wait before signalling
to Burroughs on the <i>Stella</i>. I was now quite easy in
mind about the issue, and as no one could enter the
cabin without making noise enough to wake me, there
was no reason why I should not go to sleep.</p>

<p>The yacht was under weigh almost as soon as I
was placed in the cabin and, so far as I could gauge
the speed, was making no more than from ten to
twelve knots.</p>

<p>I was just dropping off to sleep when some one tried
the door and was apparently very much astonished to
find it fastened on my side. It must have seemed
something like a conjuring trick for a &#8220;king&#8221; gagged
and bound, as I was, to have accomplished such a feat.</p>

<p>I took no notice, of course. There was some whispered
consultation followed by more knocking and more
whispering, and then I was left at peace. They concluded,
no doubt, that as they could force the door
at any time, there was no use in doing so until we were
near Oporto; and that if I preferred to remain gagged,
instead of allowing them to release me, the &#8220;royal&#8221;
prerogative entitled me to punish myself.</p>

<p>Anyhow, they went away and I went to sleep, and
did not wake until the dawn was breaking. I had
very little doubt that I passed a more comfortable
night than any one else on the yacht.</p>

<p>I opened the porthole and shoving my head through
was intensely pleased to see the <i>Stella</i> under easy
steam about a mile astern. I waved a towel as a
signal to the skipper to close up, and having edged
it and left it fluttering, I looked carefully to see that
my revolver was loaded, and sat down to speculate as
to what form the crisis would take.</p>

<p>As the <i>Stella</i> could steam two knots to the <i>Rampallo&#8217;s</i>
one, a few minutes after my signal was observed would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
bring matters to a head. But those minutes might
bring trouble my way, of course.</p>

<p>The first sign of it was a hurried trampling of feet
on the deck over my head, followed almost directly by a
loud knocking at my cabin door and an angry demand
for me to open it.</p>

<p>I let them knock and call as they pleased and then
some one said that the door was to be broken in. But I
did not wish that to be done and did wish to make
delay, so I rapped back loudly with the butt of my
revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open the door at once,&#8221; came in loud angry tones.</p>

<p>Putting my handkerchief to my mouth I yelled
back a lot of muffled unintelligible gibberish. An
altercation followed in which they continued to call
to me to open and I replied with the same sort of rot
and played with the bolts as if fumbling in an attempt
to unfasten them.</p>

<p>In this way I gained two or three invaluable minutes,
and a glance out of the porthole showed me that the
<i>Stella</i> was coming up very fast.</p>

<p>Their impatience drove them to act at last; and the
first blow was struck to force the way in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait. I&#8217;ll open it,&#8221; I shouted.</p>

<p>I drew the bolts and stepped back as a hail came
across the water in Burroughs&#8217; stentorian tones.</p>

<p>There are many ways of showing astonishment, and
most of them were conspicuous as the door flew open
and four men started to rush in and then jumped back
from my levelled weapon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen, I should like to know what the
devil you mean by kidnapping me in this way,&#8221; I sang
out and then, to their further astonishment, I burst
out laughing.</p>

<p>If my life had depended upon my keeping serious,
I could not have helped laughing at the ridiculous figures
they cut. It was not so much their boundless amazement
at seeing me instead of the king, nor their quick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
retreat from my weapon, but their general appearance
which was so irresistibly comic.</p>

<p>They wore neither coat, waistcoat, nor collar, their
trousers were rolled up to the knees, in their shirts of
finest linen were gold studs and the sleeves were rolled
up to the elbows, their boots were faultless in fit,
all four wore gloves, and two of them carried pince-nez;
while from the top to toe they were smothered
in a mixture of machine oil, perspiration and coal
dust.</p>

<p>They looked for all the world like amateur greasers
badly made up and coming straight from the comic
opera stage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you and where is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; stammered one
of them, when a companion stopped him and stepped
forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave this to me,&#8221; he said and then to me: &#8220;Who
are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the king of Portugal, of course&mdash;Dom Carlos,&#8221;
I replied, trying to keep my face straight. &#8220;Where
is Captain Gompez?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Captain Gompez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve had rather a rough night of it,
captain. Stokehole work is trying for an amateur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you, sir? I&#8217;m in no mood for fooling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think not after such an experience. But
as you are the owner of this boat, tell me why you
brought me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>As I said this I saw one of the younger men&mdash;a red-headed,
fiery-looking fellow&mdash;pull off his gloves furtively
and begin to reach for his hip pocket. &#8220;If
either of you attempts to draw on me I shall fire at
whoever&#8217;s nearest to me,&#8221; I sang out in a very different
tone.</p>

<p>Captain Gompez was the nearest and he promptly
turned and stopped the fellow who then tried to sneak
away.</p>

<p>But I wouldn&#8217;t have that either. &#8220;You stop just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
where you are,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I&#8217;m like your leader here&mdash;in
no mood for fooling.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Burroughs fired the blank cartridge
from the <i>Stella</i>, and some one called excitedly for
Captain Gompez.</p>

<p>Taken aback by the unexpected development, all
four started and I took advantage of the moment
when their eyes were off me to grab hold of the captain
and drag him into the cabin and then slammed the
door to and shot home one of the bolts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we can talk this&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before I could finish the sentence he flung himself
upon me with an oath in a desperate effort to grab
my weapon, while he shouted to the others to break
in the door.</p>

<p>Like a fool I had allowed myself to be taken by
surprise, and in a second he had me pinned against
the wall and at a terrible disadvantage.</p>

<p>I could not use my weapon, and my life depended
on my preventing him from getting it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>A TIGHT CORNER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CAPTAIN GOMPEZ was about my own height
but very strong, as agile as a cat, and mad with
rage. Under equal conditions I should have had no
chance in such a struggle with him. Fortunately for
me, however, the conditions were not equal.</p>

<p>He had been up all night, hard at work in laborious
and unusual toil. He was responsible for the management
of the <i>Rampallo</i> and had had to teach his crew
of amateurs their work, and he was also the leader
in this critical part of the abduction plot. The combined
strain of all this had told on him and made tremendous
demands upon his strength and endurance.</p>

<p>At the same time, he had the two most powerful
motives which can drive a man to set his life on an
issue such as that involved in this attack on me. He
knew that in some way I had thwarted the plot, and
the knowledge filled him with a frenzy of rage, while
he believed that, on his success in overpowering me,
depended not only his own safety but that of all who
were relying upon his leadership. This rendered him
desperate.</p>

<p>My advantage was that I was as fresh as paint after
the hours of sleep I had had during the night; and I
felt that if I could hold my own in the first minutes of
the affair, the frantic efforts he was making would tire
him out and give me the victory. Time would give me
another advantage. The <i>Stella</i> would soon be alongside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
when Burroughs would quickly have command
of the <i>Rampallo</i>.</p>

<p>The struggle between us began in a somewhat curious
fashion. The attack had taken me by surprise, as I
have said, and forced me back against the side of the
cabin. As he grabbed for the revolver, I shot my
right hand up as high as I could stretch it, to hold the
weapon out of his reach. You may have seen one child
use a similar tactic when teasing another, and you
may know how difficult it is to bend an arm held rigid
in such a position, when there is no marked advantage
in height.</p>

<p>That was the problem the captain had to solve,
and he fought with tremendous energy. He held
my right wrist in his left, tugging and straining to
lever it down so that he might venture to release his
right, which held my left in a grip of steel, and grab
the prize.</p>

<p>His shouts to the others to break the door open
were not answered, and he soon ceased to call, concentrating
all his strength in the struggle for my weapon.</p>

<p>He displayed such strength that I realized he would
beat me before the energy which frenzy gave him was
exhausted; and as I was convinced that the first use
he would make of his victory would be to put a
bullet into my head, I resolved to empty the revolver
as a defensive measure.</p>

<p>I fired three shots in rapid succession when he suddenly
released my left arm and fastened both hands
on my right wrist and tugged and strained at it in the
desperate effort to drag the weapon within his reach.</p>

<p>This was more than I could resist, and I thought
he would dislocate my shoulder and wrench the sinews.
But I succeeded in discharging two more cartridges before
my power of resistance was broken, and then I let the
weapon fall and at the same moment I got my left
hand on his throat and pressing my foot against the
wall pushed him violently backwards.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>The man&#339;uvre took him by surprise and he slipped
and fell, dragged me down with him, to resume the
struggle under different conditions. I had some
advantage now, however. I was top dog. But he
writhed and wriggled with such agility that I could
make little use of my position.</p>

<p>He fought at this stage like a savage. He kicked
me viciously, butted my face with his head, tried
every trick to get his hands on my throat, writhing
the while like a snake to change his position so that
he could wriggle back to the spot where the revolver
lay, the possession of which meant life or death to me
and freedom or ruin to him.</p>

<p>Again I realized that he was the better man and
that I was going to be beaten. By a very clever movement
he got me again at a terrible disadvantage. I
was holding on to his throat when he twisted to one
side, drew his knees up with a sudden jerk and thrust
one of his feet into the pit of my stomach with such
force as to drive the wind clean out of me. My grip
on his throat relaxed and I fell back sick and dizzy
and beaten.</p>

<p>Only the merest luck saved my life then. As I fell,
my hand came in contact with the revolver and I
gripped it and pulled the trigger. Even as the shot
flashed, he was on to me; and he wrenched the weapon
from me, and pulled the trigger three or four times at
my head in the hope that there was still a cartridge
left.</p>

<p>Maddened with rage and disappointment he raised
it and tried to strike me on the head; but I had
sense enough to protect myself with my arms, and then
my rage began to lend me strength. I grappled with
him again, and as the effects of the kick passed off
and I recovered my wind, I renewed the fight.</p>

<p>I was in a very different mood now. He had attempted
to take my life and I no longer tried merely to exhaust
his strength. I fought like a madman. For the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
moment, indeed, I was mad, crazed with blood lust,
white-hot for revenge.</p>

<p>Disappointment at finding the weapon, which he
had striven so frantically to gain, useless, disheartened
him; his strength was nearly used up and he had
no passion left to answer to that which burned like a
fever in me.</p>

<p>I got him under me again, my left hand fastened on
his throat while I dashed my fist again and again
into his face, finding a brutal pleasure in the punishment
I inflicted, until his resistance weakened and he
lay still and helpless.</p>

<p>Then I rose and sat on the berth, breathing hard
and watching him as if he were some dangerous wild
beast who had mauled me and from whose fangs I had
only just escaped with my life&mdash;as indeed I had.</p>

<p>I was not seriously hurt. That kick of his had only
winded me. My arms were painful from the blows I
had received from the revolver in shielding my head,
but they were only bruised, and I had every cause
to be glad matters were no worse.</p>

<p>Nor was my opponent badly injured. His face was
damaged and his lips swollen and bleeding, but the
blood was chiefly from his nose; and he soon recovered
sufficiently to sit up.</p>

<p>His first movement brought me to my feet, but he
had no strength left to make any fight. Moreover
my own rage had cooled and, to tell the truth, I was
a little ashamed of my savagery; so I made no effort
to interfere with him.</p>

<p>He spat out some of the blood from his mouth and
had plenty more on his face, so I threw him a towel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to try any more of this?&#8221; I
asked.</p>

<p>He was wiping his face with the towel, and paused
to look up at me, shook his head, and continued his
task.</p>

<p>At that moment the <i>Stella</i> came alongside with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
force which sent a shiver through the <i>Rampallo</i> from
stern to stern; and the sounds of the trampling of
many feet on the deck above our heads followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he exclaimed and started to scramble
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find it safer to stop just where you are,&#8221;
I said curtly.</p>

<p>He glanced up at me and, not liking my looks,
abandoned the attempt. &#8220;What is the meaning of
it all?&#8221; he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on this boat the night before last when you
were all discussing your plans and I decided to play
the king&#8217;s part in this business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; and he ran his eyes over my much slighter
form.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find the remainder of His Majesty under the
bunk here; the shot-weighted clothes and all the rest
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s your object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. I had one and have gained it. My
yacht, the <i>Stella</i>, followed us all through the night;
and the row up there means that my men have just
come aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The racket on deck was dying down now and I soon
heard Burroughs calling my name loudly and anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Donnington! Ralph! Where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>I opened the cabin door and answered him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is all well with you?&#8221; he cried, eagerly. &#8220;I
was getting worried about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Jack, but it was touch and go,
owing to Captain Gompez here, the leader of the lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Been making trouble, has he? Have you left any
kick in him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with us?&#8221; interposed
Gompez.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send you to sea for a week in charge of my friend
here, Mr. Burroughs&mdash;and a crew chosen from my own
yacht. At the end of that time I shall probably hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
you over to the authorities with a full statement of
all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I protest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waste of time,&#8221; I cut in laconically. &#8220;Bring him
along to the rest, Jack.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went to the yacht&#8217;s saloon where the other
prisoners were. Burroughs had done things thoroughly.
There were seven of them, and he had handcuffed
them all and put a couple of men over them, with
loaded revolvers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking no risks, Ralph,&#8221; said Burroughs in
explanation, and then fastened Captain Gompez&#8217;
wrists in similar fashion.</p>

<p>A more dejected forlorn set of men I had never cast
eyes on. Grimed from head to foot, worn out with
sleeplessness, toil and anxiety, they were broken by the
utter defeat of their scheme and the certainty that
ruin, disgrace, dishonour and possibly death was all
they had to face. Two or three had dozed off, and
the rest turned as I entered and looked at me with
lack-lustre eyes without even the energy to show
anger.</p>

<p>Among those who were asleep, or feigning sleep,
was Sampayo. He was in a corner at the far end, his
face averted and his head sunk on his breast. The
arrival of the <i>Stella</i> had warned him that I was at the
bottom of the trouble, and he and the red-headed
young fellow who had tried to draw on me before
had been the only ones to give trouble; but they had
gained nothing by it except a crack on the head.</p>

<p>Sampayo was not of course aware that I knew he
was on board, and his present attitude was probably
due to the hope that he would escape my notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell your companions my decision, Captain
Gompez,&#8221; I said, and went away with Burroughs
to arrange for the stores to be transferred from the
<i>Stella</i> and discuss the steps he was to take to guard
against any trouble from the prisoner-passengers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;I shall run no risks, Ralph. I&#8217;ve been looking
round and I can separate them and shall keep them
fastened up. The old man and I discussed the course
I&#8217;d better lay. There&#8217;s none too much coal on board,
so I shall steam due west for a day and if the weather
holds good shall just crawl about until the time&#8217;s
up, and I&#8217;ve arranged where he can pick us up if you
want to before the week&#8217;s out. And of course I shall
keep well away from any vessels that may came along.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two yachts were still roped together, and while
the stores were transferred I went down to the &#8220;king&#8217;s&#8221;
cabin and told Burroughs to send Sampayo to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sent for you to write a brief letter to Dr.
Barosa telling him what has occurred,&#8221; I said without
preface.</p>

<p>&#8220;What use are you going to make of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I decide. It is possible that I may not
speak of this thing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you everything if you&#8217;ll put me ashore,&#8221;
he said after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Characteristic, but out of the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t write a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Then I&#8217;ll get one of the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at me eagerly, as if my words suggested
a hope that matters would be made easier if he complied.
&#8220;Why do you want to hound us down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as you are concerned, your old companion,
Prelot, will do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught his breath with a shudder at the mention
of the name. &#8220;That letter to Barosa will do no
good. After you showed you knew about me, I begged
and prayed him to do the only thing that would get
rid of you&mdash;and he refused.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused as if waiting for me to question him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is mad with his love for Mademoiselle Dominguez,&#8221;
he continued after a pause. &#8220;I said that if
he would let me break with her, you would go away.
He would not. It was he who planned that attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
on your life the same night. He was with Henriques.
He is mad, I say. And nothing, not even this, will
turn him from his purpose. He knows something
about that South African affair of mine, but not all.
He has had nearly all my money, he forced this farce
of an engagement with Mademoiselle Dominguez,
and his intention was to use the influence he would
have if a revolution was provoked to force her to
marry him. That&#8217;s why she has been dragged into
it, and he would sacrifice every man of us rather than
lose her. He would have been betrothed to her openly,
but he could not break with the Contesse Inglesia.
Now you know everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew most of that before,&#8221; I replied drily.
&#8220;But how did you get the visconte&#8217;s consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;He could not help himself.
He was in this thing also to some extent, but
Barosa found out that he had been stealing his wife&#8217;s
money and I was put to threaten him with exposure
if he refused. I have been Barosa&#8217;s slave for months,
curse him.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the bitter sincerity of
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do no good with the letter you want.
It is more probable that you will find that he fled
from the city the moment he knew this thing had failed
and took Mademoiselle Dominguez with him. But if
he is still there, and still hopes to provoke a revolution,
your only means of dealing with him will be
through the Contesse Inglesia. Rouse her jealousy,
and you may succeed. I would have done it, but I
dared not.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not let him see my alarm at his suggestion
that Barosa had forced Miralda to fly with him, but
I determined to get back to Lisbon as fast as the <i>Stella</i>
could carry me.</p>

<p>I took Sampayo back to the rest, wrote a line:&mdash;&#8220;We
are prisoners in the hands of Mr. Ralph Donnington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
who knows everything;&#8221; and obtained the signatures
of them all to it; and then hurried up on deck.</p>

<p>The <i>Stella</i> was just casting off, and with a last handshake
with Burroughs, I jumped on board.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long will it take us to get back to port, captain?&#8221;
I asked the skipper, who had good news for
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not much more than thirty-five knots out,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;These fools couldn&#8217;t get more than a few
knots an hour out of the <i>Rampallo</i> and didn&#8217;t even
know enough to keep a straight course. They&#8217;ve been
zigzagging about all night. Never saw such lubbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let her rip. I must be back at the earliest
moment. Get all you can out of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sampayo&#8217;s words had fired me with impatience.
A burning fever of unrest had seized me and I should
not know a second&#8217;s peace until I had assured myself
of Miralda&#8217;s safety.</p>

<p>The bare thought that she might be in Barosa&#8217;s
power and that the very act by which I had striven and
risked so much to win her, might prove to be the means
of losing her, was torture unutterable.</p>

<p>The instant we were in the river I had the launch
lowered and jumped into her and shot away to the
quay.</p>

<p>A few minutes now would tell me the best or the
worst.</p>

<small>ILL NEWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SAMPAYO&#8217;S statement had not only roused my
fears for Miralda&#8217;s safety but had also decided
me not to have any further dealings at all with Barosa.
As soon as I had satisfied myself that she was not
in any danger from him, I would go straight to Volheno
and tell him about the abduction plot and how it had
been frustrated.</p>

<p>I could make a full statement of that without in
any way violating the pledge of secrecy I had given to
Barosa. That pledge did not include either my
previous knowledge that he was an agent of the Pretender,
Dom Miguel, or anything I had overheard
on the <i>Rampallo</i> and the results.</p>

<p>I would keep my word in regard to all that had occurred
in the Rua Catania house and in the other
house in the Rua Formosa, where I had been subjected
to the &#8220;test&#8221;; and should not give the names
of any one whose connexions with the plot I had learnt
before my spy work on Captain Gompez&#8217; yacht.</p>

<p>My intention was to make one condition&mdash;that
Miralda, her mother, the visconte, Vasco and, if possible,
Dagara, should be pardoned for their complicity
in the affair. They had been forced into the net by
Barosa&#8217;s tortuous cunning, and that I could prove
if put to it.</p>

<p>I felt that I had a perfect right to impose such a
condition as the price of my services. I had thwarted
the abduction plot, and my own experiences proved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
that, but for me, nothing would have saved the king.
Moreover, I had risked my life&mdash;had very nearly
lost it, indeed&mdash;and, although I had chosen my own
method instead of turning informer in advance, that
was my own concern. But the result had been entirely
successful, for it had led to my taking a batch of the
men in it red-handed.</p>

<p>In making this decision to go at once to Volheno, I
had none but personal considerations. I had no interest
in the political issues involved in the struggle
between the Throne and the people. They were nothing
to me. The Government managed their own
affairs in their own way; and if I had been fool enough
to have offered them suggestions, they would have
laughed at me for an impertinent interfering puppy.</p>

<p>At the same time, the part of informer was a profoundly
hateful one to play, and if I could have gained
my end as easily and safely by dealing direct with
Barosa, I should have preferred that method.</p>

<p>But he was too dangerous a man. I had far too high
an opinion of his ability, shrewdness and resource
to believe for an instant that I could pit myself against
him. It was much more by accident than anything
else that I had obtained the whip-hand over him now;
and it would be sheer folly to run the risk of giving
him an opportunity to outwit me, when a word to
Volheno would lay him by the heels.</p>

<p>I took Bryant and Simmons ashore with me. I sent
the latter up to my rooms and, as I deemed it best
not to go about alone, I drove with Bryant to Miralda&#8217;s
house and left him in the carriage to wait for me.</p>

<p>My anxiety on Miralda&#8217;s account rendered me nervously
uneasy. This feeling quickened into alarm when
the servant told me she was not in the house. The
viscontesse was at home and I sent a message begging
her to see me at once.</p>

<p>The instant she entered the room I read ill news in
her manner and looks. She was greatly agitated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
her face was white and drawn, her eyes full of
trouble, and she appeared both surprised and
angry to see me. She drew back and would not take
my hand. &#8220;You asked for me, Mr. Donnington?
I wonder you dare to come here, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare to come?&#8221; I repeated, bewildered by this
reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is not Miralda with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question filled the cup of my alarm and amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some mistake, viscontesse. I have just
landed from my yacht and have come straight here
to see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake do not try to deceive me. I
know what has happened. It was cruel and shameful.
I have been beside myself with grief and suspense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word of honour I have not seen
Miralda since the day before yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stared at me as if unable to believe or even understand
me. &#8220;Have not seen her?&#8221; she repeated
hoarsely, after a pause. &#8220;Oh, that cannot be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you most earnestly and solemnly that it
is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the conviction of my sincerity was forced upon
her, her expression changed. The trouble in her wide,
staring eyes gave place to unmistakable terror inspired
by her new thoughts. Suddenly she reeled,
threw up her hands in despair, and then clasped them
distractedly to her face and sank on a couch with a
moan of anguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she is arrested or dead. Heaven have mercy
upon my dear, dear child,&#8221; she cried, a prey to
overpowering emotion.</p>

<p>I was scarcely less alarmed by this most disconcerting
news, and while the viscontesse was striving to
recover some measure of self-command, I tried to
realize all it meant and to think what to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, Mr. Donnington,&#8221; she said at length
in the midst of her sobs; and I waited, tormented by
a thousand vague fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you to tell me all as soon as possible. Even
minutes may be of vital importance,&#8221; I said earnestly.</p>

<p>She made an effort to check her wild sobs. &#8220;But
we cannot do anything,&#8221; she wailed helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you can let me know what has happened,&#8221;
I replied sharply. &#8220;If anything is to be done,
it must be at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will try to tell you,&#8221; she said a minute later,
sitting up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that Miralda was here yesterday,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;because I sent to her and received a letter from
her. That was early in the afternoon. Will you tell
me everything that occurred after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know very little, Mr. Donnington. In the afternoon
Inez came and the two were alone together. Miralda
came to me afterwards and I saw that she was
both greatly excited and distressed. It was in some
way connected with this miserable conspiracy business.
She told me that something very important was to
happen; but that she herself did not know what it
was. She was to go for the evening to Inez. I was
in great trouble about Vasco, you know. He was in
bed ill&mdash;he had been drinking heavily the night before,
I must tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he leave the house yesterday?&#8221; I interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He was getting better toward the evening
and said he had to go out; but I went up later and
found him sleeping so soundly that I could not rouse
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was Miralda in the house then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, she had been gone about half an hour. Well, I
waited by his bedside for a long time, an hour or more&mdash;I
could not say how long. When Inez arrived I went
down to her, and she asked me where Miralda was. I
said she had gone to her house. She had never reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
there, however; and then Inez said she had something
very serious to tell me. It was that Miralda had
been in secret communication with you, and that
as some of their friends suspected you of having
betrayed them in some way, Miralda had also fallen
under suspicion. She had disappeared, and one of
three things must be the cause. She had been
arrested, or had got into the hands of those who
suspected her, or had run away with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you fix the time the contesse was here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that first visit, but she came again about
ten o&#8217;clock, bringing the news that your yacht had
left the river and that it was plain that Miralda had
gone with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the <i>Stella</i> had been missed, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I tell you is true, viscontesse; I have not
seen Miralda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think she has been arrested then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible to be certain&mdash;but I do not think
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but don&#8217;t tell me you believe she has fallen
into the hands of any of these people who will do her
mischief? They would kill her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; I am certain that there is no fear of that.&#8221;
I was, for it was as clear as anything could be that
Barosa would not allow anything of the sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so positive. Do you know anything that
makes you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I cannot tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You get to learn so much. I suppose you know
that my husband has left the city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. When was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You warned him one afternoon that he was
under suspicion; and he left the next night. He
has gone to Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would to Heaven you and Miralda had gone with
him,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were going; but Miralda was prevented.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;How prevented?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Barosa and Inez arrived when all was ready,
and after what they said to her, she told me she could
not go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they let the visconte go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I could have gone too&mdash;but I could not leave
my dear child.&#8221;</p>

<p>I began to get a grip of the situation now.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Vasco? Can I see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is on duty this morning. He is better. What
are you going to do?&#8221; she asked as I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;To find Miralda.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray God you may be successful. You will let
me know?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a promise to do so, I left her. I had very
little doubt that I should find Miralda with Inez. She
had been taken away from her home as the result
of that attempt at flight; and Barosa had used
Inez for the purpose. The thing must have been
planned before the failure of the previous night&#8217;s
scheme was known; and being uncertain of the
issue, he was still afraid to break with Inez.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances he might have employed
different means&mdash;getting Miralda into his own hands;
but he would shrink from rousing Inez&#8217; jealousy until
he felt strong enough to set her at defiance.</p>

<p>What the effect upon him would be of the failure
of the scheme was of course very difficult to say.
But it was not of much consequence unless he had
already got Miralda away and I should know that as
soon as I saw Inez herself.</p>

<p>The lie which had been told about my having carried
Miralda away was intended merely to blind her
mother&#8217;s eyes. It offered a plausible reason for
Miralda&#8217;s absence.</p>

<p>As I drove to Inez&#8217; house I told Bryant to wait
for me, but not to remain in the carriage, as I did not
wish him to be seen; and as soon as the servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
opened the door, I pushed my way in, lest Inez should
refuse to see me.</p>

<p>She did make the attempt. In reply to my message,
she sent word that she was unable to see me
then, but would do so an hour later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will wait,&#8221; I told the servant; and down
I sat in the hall. Inez&#8217; unwillingness to face me confirmed
my opinion that Miralda was in the house;
and nothing short of force would have made me leave.</p>

<p>After perhaps a quarter of an hour the servant
came with another message&mdash;her mistress would
receive me in a few minutes. She was leading the way
upstairs when I stopped her, saying bluntly I preferred
to remain where I was until the contesse was quite
ready.</p>

<p>I did not intend to give Inez a chance of smuggling
Miralda out of the house while I was cooling my
heels shut up in a room upstairs. Whether or not any
attempt of the sort had been planned, I do not know;
but while I was close to the door and had a full view
of the staircase it was impracticable.</p>

<p>Another delay followed, and then the servant said
Inez was waiting for me; and she herself appeared
at the top of the stairs, cool, smiling, and apologetic.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry to have kept you waiting, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
she said as she gave me her hand, and led
the way into an adjoining room; &#8220;but your call at
this unusual hour found me quite unprepared to come
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a conventional purpose which has brought
me, madame,&#8221; I replied as she settled herself gracefully
upon a couch.</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Ah, well, I am grateful to any purpose
which leads you to find your way at last to my house,&#8221;
she said with another smile.</p>

<p>I was in no mood for this kind of thing; so I said
rather bluntly: &#8220;My purpose is to see Mademoiselle
Dominguez.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Her start and look and gesture of extreme surprise
were well acted. &#8220;My dear Mr. Donnington! Miralda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she paused, and then those strange eyes
of hers expressed perplexity and trouble and rising
alarm. &#8220;I am afraid I&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet my words were very simple. I wish to see
Mademoiselle Dominguez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that, of course. But is it possible, you
believe she is here? Do you mean you do not know
what has occurred? You find out so many things,
you know,&#8221; she added with a quick thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that she came here last night. I have
seen her mother this morning; but, as you suggest,
I do find out things. You were under the impression
last night that she did not reach your house; but&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;and
I paused as I made a shot, speaking very meaningly&mdash;&#8220;I
know how she came to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>A single swift up-lift of the deeply fringed lids told
me that the unexpected shot had pierced the armour-plate
of her defence; and when she looked up after a
pause all the assumption of surprise had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have only yourself to blame, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
she said, tone and manner both very earnest.
She had as many moods as an actress has costumes
and was able to change them much more quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that means&mdash;what, if you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am genuinely sorry for you. I knew from the
first that your object here was Miralda; and you
will remember that I warned you. You would not
heed the warning. You set to work to win back
Miralda; and had she been free, you would have succeeded.
But she was not free; and when you took
the mad step of driving Major Sampayo from the city
you&mdash;well, you can understand what was sure to
follow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;On the contrary I do not understand, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You precipitated matters, of course. Miralda
is Major Sampayo&#8217;s wife and is now with his
friends.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN SIGHT OF VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">INEZ&#8217; face as she said this was full of excellently
simulated solicitude for me; but had she been
aware of all I knew about Sampayo&#8217;s movements, she
would certainly have chosen some other fairy tale
with which to fool me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid some one has been misleading you,&#8221;
I said drily; &#8220;unless, of course, you were present at
the wedding?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her own instinct or my manner warned her that
she had blundered. &#8220;I was&mdash;not present, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;
She began the reply quickly, and the slight
pause in the sentence came when she suddenly changed
her mind; and the last words were spoken in a very
different tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;When is the marriage said to have occurred?
I don&#8217;t wish to question you in the dark, and will
tell you that I know precisely all Major Sampayo&#8217;s
recent movements. Let me suggest, therefore, that
it is quite useless to fence with my questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fixed her eyes on me with a steady searching
look. &#8220;Are you threatening me, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am asking you to let me see Mademoiselle Dominguez
at once, madame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you she is with Major Sampayo&#8217;s
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are one of those friends. Mademoiselle
Dominguez is here,&#8221; I said as positively as if I knew it
for a fact.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>For a moment I thought she was going to give in;
but her features set and she threw her head back with
a toss of defiance. &#8220;You must have seen a yacht in
the river for the last two days, the <i>Rampallo</i>. It is
Major Sampayo&#8217;s; and Miralda joined him there last
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Rampallo</i> belongs to Captain Gompez, and I
passed last night on board her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright and stared at me, every muscle
and nerve strained and set, her face as white as her lace
and the pupils of her weird eyes dilated with sudden
fear and wonder. For several seconds she was unable
to utter a word, as she realized all that must lie behind
my words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will now, perhaps, deem it prudent not to
refuse any longer to bring Mademoiselle Dominguez
here to me,&#8221; I said very meaningly.</p>

<p>She lowered her head with a deep sigh and sat thinking,
then rose with a little shiver of fear. &#8220;I will
fetch her,&#8221; she murmured and went out of the room.</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of satisfaction at my victory.
It was a telling proof of the strength of my hold over
her and all who were leagued with her in this persecution
of Miralda.</p>

<p>I had to wait about a quarter of an hour before she
returned, bringing Miralda, who was pale and worn
and nervous.</p>

<p>Inez did not enter the room, but closed the door,
leaving us alone, as I took Miralda&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why have you come here, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To take you away. I have come straight here from
your mother and am going to take you back to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I cannot go,&#8221; she replied, shaking her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I attempt to leave here, I shall be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the tale they have told you to keep you
here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;It is true. Do you know what happened last
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; a great deal better than you or any
one else in this house. I urge you to come away at once
with me; and I will tell you everything that occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I dare not,&#8221; she said, shrinking away from me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I tell you that you have absolutely nothing
to fear. You can trust me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, yes. You know that; but I&mdash;dare not
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was evident that by some means they had succeeded
in breaking down her nerve. &#8220;Let me urge you to
come at once&mdash;just as you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that a mad attempt was made to
make the king a prisoner; that it failed and has
been discovered; and that all concerned in it are
now in danger of their lives? I had no idea of such
a shameful plot, or I would never have done what I
have. There is no hope for any of us but flight;
and Dr. Barosa is arranging for us to fly secretly this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know much more than that. I know why it
failed. I have every reason to know, because I
myself prevented the attempt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; she cried in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I. No one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you knew this terrible thing and did not
warn me? And yet you knew I was implicated! Oh,
how could you?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a point of view which had not occurred
to me. She had good reason to blame me; and for
the moment I was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no answer? If you had told me, do you
think I would not have given a warning of it even at the
risk of my life?&#8221; and with a despondent sigh she
dropped into a chair and sat staring helplessly at the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are forgetting that I myself prevented it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>&#8220;Yes, but my life is now in danger. You do not understand
what it is you have done. You did what you
deemed best, of course; but you do not understand.
They are hunting the city for us all now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These people have merely told you that to frighten
you. No one has been even to your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how little you understand. They are waiting
because it is known that I have left there. The instant
I leave here I shall be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how could you escape this afternoon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez and Dr. Barosa have arranged that. We shall
go in disguise, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who told you that the plot had been discovered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think they do not know that? M.
Dagara sent them warning last night, and told them the
names of those who are to be arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything you tell me only confirms what I say
to you&mdash;that these lies have been coined in order to
frighten you. M. Dagara is not in Lisbon. He left
yesterday evening. I gave him money to take him
and his wife to Paris. He did not even know that the
abduction had been planned; and he left the city
before he could hear of its failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I know you think that&mdash;but
I have the list of names.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you show it me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She took it out of the bosom of her dress and handed
it me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trick is obvious,&#8221; I said with a smile. &#8220;It is
not his handwriting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez made a copy for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But did not show you the original. It is a lie&mdash;the
whole thing. Do try to understand it all by the
light of what I tell you. Why, here on the very face
of it is a proof of its falsehood. Your mother&#8217;s name
is mentioned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I have not seen it?&#8221; she cried,
intensely moved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;Yes, but I have come straight from her to you. If
she had been listed for arrest, should I have found
her at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is left at liberty because they expect me to
return to her, when we should both be arrested.
That is why I have not gone home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But surely you can see that that is inconsistent with
the other thing they told you&mdash;that you would be taken
the moment you left this house? They have put
your mother&#8217;s name on this concocted list in order to
frighten you, and vamped this utterly false explanation.
If the police are watching your home, you can safely
leave here; if, on the other hand, they know how to find
you without your going home, why is not your mother
already arrested?&#8221;</p>

<p>This made some impression. &#8220;I do not know what
to think,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is another thing. If you are to run into
danger the instant you leave here, it means that the
police know where you are. Do you suppose that, in
such a case, they would not have raided this house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez is not on the list.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another proof that the whole thing is a fabrication.
If the police had such intimate knowledge of the plot
that they knew of your slight connexion with it,
would they not know of the leaders?&#8221;</p>

<p>She considered a moment. &#8220;But you yourself
knew that the visconte and all of us were suspected.
You told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ascertained afterwards that I was wrong. Dagara
told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should Inez be so false as you suggest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is instigated by Dr. Barosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is his motive, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an awkward question. &#8220;I know the motive;
but you may doubt the truth. Let me tell you first
what has occurred. When I learnt the truth as to
the abduction plot&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;When did you learn it, and how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was present on the <i>Rampallo</i> when they all met there,
and I overheard the whole matter discussed and settled.
I then planned matters so that I should be mistaken
for the king and carried off in his stead. That was
done last night. I was taken to the <i>Rampallo</i> and was
on her all the night. My own yacht followed; and this
morning my people boarded the <i>Rampallo</i>, released me
and made prisoners of every man on the yacht.
Under the charge of my friend, Mr. Burroughs, the
<i>Rampallo</i> has been sent off with the men and I came
back to free you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could that free me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one of two ways. Either by forcing Dr. Barosa
to free you from all connexion with the conspiracy;
or by making your pardon a condition of my handing
over these men to the authorities with a full statement
of what had occurred. Now, except myself and those
in my confidence on the <i>Stella</i>, there is not a man
in Lisbon, outside those in the plot, who knows the
facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened in rapt attention, sat thinking a few
moments, and then put out her hand. &#8220;Can you
forgive me for hesitating to go with you? I have
been distracted with fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive. All I ask is that you
come with me at once. You would be safer in the
hands of the police than here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me why? And you have not explained Dr.
Barosa&#8217;s object. He has been kindness itself in all
this trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He stopped you from leaving with the visconte,&#8221;
I reminded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a reason. My presence was still necessary
to get the information from M. Dagara. But
Dr. Barosa and Inez are going to take my mother and
myself away to-day to join the visconte in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will do nothing of the kind. They are false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
to you right through. The contesse herself is being
deceived by Barosa. Sampayo is among the men on
the <i>Rampallo</i>; and I got from him to-day the real
truth why you were compelled to betroth yourself
to him. It is not a pretty story, but you must hear it.
He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I stopped abruptly as Inez entered.</p>

<p>She was smiling, but far less collectedly than usual.
&#8220;Well, have you persuaded Mr. Donnington that
you must remain here, Miralda?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am going with him, Inez.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do as you please, of course, but you
know the danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not think we can take care of her, Mr. Donnington?
What have you told her to cause this change
of plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will gladly tell you all I have said if you will accompany
us. Miralda is naturally anxious to reassure
her mother as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish to do so, thank you; but we shall
have a minute or two while Miralda gets ready. And
I wish to have a word with you privately, Mr. Donnington,
after what you told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be ready in a minute,&#8221; said Miralda with
a smile as she went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do, Mr. Donnington?&#8221;
asked Inez. &#8220;There can, of course, be only one meaning
to your statement&mdash;that you were on the <i>Rampallo</i>
last night. Are you going to betray us?&#8221; She was
greatly agitated and made little attempt to conceal it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not necessarily. I have no concern with your
politics or plots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you have interfered in this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the sole purpose of making sure of Miralda&#8217;s
liberty. When she has left the city, and if she is not
implicated any further, and a full explanation is made
in writing of the means adopted to force her to do
what she has done&mdash;a statement which must also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
include the persecution of the rest of her family&mdash;there
may be no reason why I should not keep silent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will be&mdash;if you prefer it put more definitely. But
that statement, signed by both yourself and Dr. Barosa,
must be in my hands within an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Major Sampayo?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;I care for nothing but
Miralda&#8217;s welfare in this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a generous enemy, Mr. Donnington. There
will be no difficulty in doing all you ask. May I&mdash;may
I thank you?&#8221; and she held out her hand. &#8220;I
have not forgotten that you saved my life, and only
regret that I have been powerless to help you with Miralda
until you have forced me. I hope you will bear me
no malice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my way, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me how you learnt of last night&#8217;s
plot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you did not ask me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some one betrayed it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But you must not press me to give you any
more details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you cannot have done it alone; and you
will see that for Miralda&#8217;s sake we ought to know if any
traitor is amongst us. He might carry information in
the future to others, and then all this would come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat I do not know of any traitor in your ranks.
I cannot say any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But who knows beside yourself?&#8221; she persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one on whose silence I cannot rely as surely as
you may rely upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Donnington&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can say no more. And now Miralda should be
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am agitated and had actually forgotten her. I
will go and see what is keeping her;&#8221; and she went
away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>I was now very impatient to be out of the house.
I had gained all I had striven for so desperately; and
there was really no solid reason why I should turn informer.
If this abduction scheme was not discovered
by the Government, no suspicion in any future plot
would fall upon Miralda.</p>

<p>Her flight from the city would not be connected
with any trouble of the sort; and when we reached
Paris, it would be my fault if in a few hours she was not
my wife.</p>

<p>The Sampayo complication was ended; and he would
never dare to cross my path or hers again. If he did,
the means of getting rid of him would still be available,
so long as Prelot&#8217;s thirst for vengeance lasted.</p>

<p>There was Vasco. I could not see at once what to
do in regard to him. But Miralda and I could discuss
his future with the viscontesse. Probably the best
thing would be for him to throw up his commission and
join us. He had been a fool and must pay for his
folly.</p>

<p>There was also Barosa. If Sampayo had spoken the
truth about his love for Miralda, he would be mad
with Inez for letting her go. It was all for the best,
therefore, that he was not in the house. I might have
found much more difficulty in getting Miralda away.</p>

<p>Yet he could not have prevented me. The weapon
I held was too strong. Not only his liberty and even
his life were in my hands, but those of Inez and of every
one associated with him in the plot. My silence was
worth infinitely more than the price I asked. At the
same time I was more than glad that I had had to deal
with Inez instead of him.</p>

<p>While I was occupied in these thoughts several
minutes passed, and my impatience at Miralda&#8217;s delay
in returning mounted fast and I began to grow uneasy.
She had promised to be back almost at once; and
had now been absent more than a quarter of as
hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>I recalled the former suspicion which had led to my
remaining in the hall, and reflected that it might be
best to go down there again.</p>

<p>Then the door opened and with a sigh of relief I
turned to meet her.</p>

<p>But instead of Miralda, it was Dr. Barosa who
entered.</p>

<small>DR. BAROSA SCORES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BAROSA was carrying a sheet or two of writing
paper, and in the glance I caught of his profile
as he shut the door carefully behind him, I noticed
that his hard strong features were paler than usual.
His set determined expression and manner were those
of a man who knows he is face to face with a grave
crisis.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised to see me, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
he said as he turned to me; and his voice, deep and
vibrating, confirmed my diagnosis.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me explain. The Contesse Inglesia has told
me what has passed between you and that you desire
to have a written statement from me concerning
Mademoiselle Dominguez and her relations; and I
thought it could be more conveniently drawn up at
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am waiting for her to leave the house with
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am aware of that. She will no doubt be here in
a moment and can perhaps assist us in writing this.
Will you tell me what you wish written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told the contesse; and you are quite able
to do all I need,&#8221; I answered shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will understand how profoundly I myself
am concerned by all this. My liberty, my life, and
what is far more to me than my life, are at stake. You
have ascertained all our plans, and I feel it imperative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
to ask what use you intend to make of anything you
compel me to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will never be used at all unless it should become
necessary in order to explain Mademoiselle Dominguez&#8217;
connexion with your plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Become necessary?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;What does
that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the plot should be discovered and she should
be in any danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it has been discovered already. It has failed.
You discovered it because of the facts which had come
to your knowledge as the result of the Rua Catania
affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not intend to discuss the matter with you,
Dr. Barosa. You can do as you please about writing
what I require.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;You must infer what
you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put it on another ground. I accepted unconditionally
your pledge of secrecy and was instrumental
in saving you subsequently from very serious
consequences at the hands of those who questioned
your good faith. As a return for that service I ask
you to tell me exactly what you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The service of which you speak was followed by
your secret visit to my rooms&mdash;with Henriques; and
Major Sampayo told me this morning the object of
that visit,&#8221; I said very drily. &#8220;Sampayo was very
frank about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; he asked, quite unruffled by
this thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can ask him on his return. And now, I am
going.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had remained close to the door and he turned
and locked it and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our interview cannot end in this abrupt way, Mr.
Donnington. The cause I have at heart may be ruined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
by you. You have told Contesse Inglesia that you
were on the <i>Rampallo</i> the night before last, and I must
know what you overheard and what use you intend
to make of that information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Open that door or give me the key,&#8221; I said sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do neither. I am armed, as probably you
are; and if you wish to force a struggle you must do
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a fool, I had come without a revolver; but I
clapped my hand to my pocket as if I had one there;
and then paused. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want your blood on my
head,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>But he was not deceived. &#8220;Ah, I perceive you
have not thought that precaution necessary,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;Well, I mean you no harm, but we must
talk this thing out and then I pledge you my word to
open the door. Will you answer my questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was, in a mess, and if I was to get out, it would not
be by force; unless I could succeed in catching him
off his guard. So I threw myself into a chair and
laughed. &#8220;You are right. I am not armed. But
the weapon I have is stronger than a revolver. I had
my suspicions roused about the <i>Rampallo</i>, and I got
on board her in time to hear all your discussion on
the news which M. Dagara sent you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, as a spy!&#8221; he sneered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; as a spy, if you like. As a result, Captain
Gompez and his companions carried me off instead
of the king; and this morning my men from the
<i>Stella</i> came aboard and I returned here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are my friends now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the <i>Rampallo</i> in charge of my people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you interfere? What could it matter
to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know perfectly well. Sampayo told you, after
my interview with him three days ago. He begged
you to cut the net in which you had involved Mademoiselle
Dominguez. He told me this morning what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
I had only suspected before and what the Contesse
Inglesia does not even suspect&mdash;your real motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has lied to you of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lies or truth, it doesn&#8217;t alter the present situation.
Even if you draw your revolver and put one of its
bullets in my head you won&#8217;t help matters. I have
taken that precaution, you may be perfectly certain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to betray us all to the Government?&#8221;
he asked after a pause, during which he drew his hand
slowly from his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what I have already told the contesse.
My object is entirely personal. You can fight out
your battle with your Government in your own way;
but I mean to gain my end. When once that is gained,
I shan&#8217;t be more minutes in Lisbon than I can help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he paused. He realized no doubt that he
had to choose between giving up Miralda or sacrificing
his cause and all concerned in it. A dilemma searching
enough to make him thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will give me your pledge to keep absolutely
silent?&#8221; he asked at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for me to impose conditions, not for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do I know that all has occurred as you tell
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can please yourself. I have a paper signed
by Sampayo and Gompez and all the rest of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show it me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>This might offer me the chance I sought. I took
it out and held it toward him, intending to close with
him the instant he came near enough. But he was
too wary. &#8220;Throw it to me,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can read it from there,&#8221; I replied, and held it
up so that he could do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is the <i>Rampallo</i> now?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled and shook my head. &#8220;I have been very
frank as to what has occurred; but what is going to
occur is my own business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;You say these men have let you make them
prisoners?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say so themselves here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they are absolutely in your power to deliver
them up to the Government when you please?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. And they will be given up and a
full statement of the facts made, unless I determine
otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>That hit him as hard as I intended.</p>

<p>&#8220;When?&#8221; he rapped out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That also I must leave you guessing. If you are
under the belief that by keeping me here or doing me
any sort of mischief you will prevent all this getting
out, you are merely deluding yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused once more and then tossed up his hands.
&#8220;You have left me no option,&#8221; he said with a sigh.
&#8220;What do you wish me to write?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That Mademoiselle Dominguez and her brother
were forced into this affair by you and that she was
never aware of the nature of the communications she
received from Dagara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will write it,&#8221; he said at once. &#8220;Here is the
key of the door;&#8221; and he threw the key to me as he
crossed to a table and sat down to write.</p>

<p>I drew a breath of relief. I had won more easily than
I had anticipated. Whatever his intentions had been
at the outset of the interview, he had apparently
abandoned them on learning that to do anything to
me would not avert discovery or save his companions.</p>

<p>He found some difficulty in wording the paper and
tore up a couple of sheets with an exclamation of
impatience. Several minutes were spent in this
way.</p>

<p>When he had finished the writing he handed it to
me. &#8220;Will that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>I read it carefully. It was almost in the words I
had used, and I folded it up and put it in my pocket,
well satisfied that, should any emergency arise requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
its use, it would prove a sufficient confirmation of
the story I had to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am satisfied,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will leave Lisbon at once, Mr. Donnington,
and will keep absolutely silent as to all that has
occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, unless circumstances arise in which I am compelled
to use this document on Mademoiselle Dominguez&#8217;
behalf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite understand that, and can accept your
word absolutely,&#8221; he replied. As I went toward the
door, he added: &#8220;You will pardon the means I
adopted to secure this interview, and will understand
how vital it was that I should know the position precisely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as you recognize it, that&#8217;s enough for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wait one moment,&#8221; he cried, as I put the key
in the lock. &#8220;We have forgotten one very important
point. I have been intensely disturbed by all this,
as you will have seen; and that is the cause of my
oversight. You will arrange for my friends to be set
at liberty at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly; as soon as practicable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not possible. The <i>Rampallo</i> is out at
sea. I will send the <i>Stella</i> after her; but it will be
at least two days before the two yachts can be back in
port.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face clouded. &#8220;That is very serious. These
officers are absent from their regiment without leave
and exceedingly awkward questions may be asked.
It may mean ruin for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume they knew the risk they were running.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had they succeeded there would have been no
risk of course. On the contrary, they would have
had their reward. Had the cause of their failure
been other than it was, they would have been able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
return to duty at once; but as it is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he broke off
and paced the room in great perturbation. &#8220;Could
you have them put on shore somewhere along the coast
so as to save time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. The <i>Rampallo</i> has steamed straight out into
the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tossed up his hands with an exclamation of
despair. &#8220;I beg you to remain a minute while we
consider this. I can think of but one way. It may
be two days, you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly less,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;We parted company
this morning about seven o&#8217;clock. The <i>Rampallo</i>
makes about eight or nine knots under easy steam
and was about forty miles out. The <i>Stella</i> covers
two knots to her one; and if we assume that the
<i>Rampallo</i> has nine hours start, and allow for the time
necessary to pick her up, the <i>Stella</i> should reach her
in about twelve hours. The <i>Rampallo</i> would be about
twenty-four hours on the homeward run and should
make the river the day after to-morrow in the early
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they returned in your yacht they would be here
sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the <i>Stella</i> will not return here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you not let her do so? The matter is very
serious indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I shall send orders that my men are to return
to the <i>Stella</i>. Those who took the <i>Rampallo</i> to sea
must bring her back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not be surprised if I press you to let them
return in your yacht. I do press it, very earnestly
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, Dr. Barosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I must fall back on my first thought.
The <i>Rampallo</i> must be wrecked, and Gompez and the
rest take to the boat. That would give a plausible
reason for their absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. It was certainly ingenious. &#8220;The weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
has been rather against anything of that sort,&#8221; I
reminded him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not serious. As I gather it, you will send
out an order at once to your boat to go after the <i>Rampallo</i>
and just take off the men you have on her. Will
you let me send a letter by&mdash;your captain will it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Bolton.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, will you let me send a letter by him to Gompez?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you give it me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to write it at once and, as before, found
difficulty in framing it, and tore up several sheets.
&#8220;I can trust your captain to deliver it unopened?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can. But I must ask you to get it
done,&#8221; I said impatiently.</p>

<p>He made a fresh start; wrote a dozen lines or so,
and again tore up the sheet, this time with a muttered
oath of vexation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to try your patience so, Mr. Donnington;
but I have been so disturbed that I am scarcely
master of my thoughts. Will you let me send this
to your boat later on? Or will you write your instructions
to your captain and let me send them both
together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that will do as well,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He got up from the table and made way for me. I
began a note to the skipper telling him to hunt up
the <i>Rampallo</i> and take off Burroughs and the men;
and was proceeding to add that he should then steam
to Plymouth, when it occurred to me that I might
possibly persuade Miralda and her mother to leave
on the <i>Stella</i> at once.</p>

<p>I paused and by chance glanced in a mirror just
opposite me, in which I saw Barosa. He was watching
me with a look of cunning, gloating triumph that in an
instant my suspicions awoke. He was fooling me.
All his show of concern for his companions, his inability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
to master his thoughts, his suggestion about
wrecking the <i>Rampallo</i> and all the rest of it, were
tricks, nothing more, to fool me to put this order into
his hands so that he might get his friends at liberty.</p>

<p>Careful not to let him know that I had seen him, I
resumed the writing. But after adding a couple of
lines I scribbled the word &#8220;Cancelled&#8221; in big sprawling
letters right across the paper, rose with a laugh and
tore it into minute fragments. &#8220;I&#8217;m like you, Dr.
Barosa, I cannot write. I&#8217;ll see my skipper and tell
him personally; and you can send your letter to him
later. I&#8217;ll tell him to wait for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will answer the same purpose, of course,&#8221;
he said, not quite successful in hiding his chagrin.
&#8220;I will send it to the yacht in less than an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you see that Mademoiselle Dominguez comes
to me?&#8221; I said, and unlocked the door.</p>

<p>As I threw open the door he caught me by the arm.
&#8220;Wait a moment, there is another&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentence was not finished. I turned at his voice
and a cloth was thrown over my head, I was seized
before I had a chance to resist, my arms were pinioned
and a gag thrust into my mouth; and I was carried
down the stairs and flung on the floor of a room the
door of which was locked and bolted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />


<small>&#8220;YOU SHALL DIE&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS not left alone very long, but it was quite
enough for me to curse my own folly for having
allowed myself to be trapped in this way. I ought
never to have entered the house at all without taking
ample precautions. I could have brought half a
dozen of the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> men with me. That was the
first stupid blunder; but even in the house itself, I
had acted like an idiot.</p>

<p>I could see the whole business plainly enough
now. Everything had been done to secure delay.
The instant I had arrived Inez had sent for Barosa,
and her talk to me had been merely intended to create
delay until he arrived. Then in order that the two
might consult together, Miralda had been brought
to me.</p>

<p>They had filled her with the fear of arrest, calculating
that she would hesitate long enough to serve
their purpose; but of course they had never intended
to allow her to leave the house. Then as their preparations
were not complete, Barosa had come to me
to cause more delay.</p>

<p>He had first detained me with a threat in order
to gain more time; and as soon as the trap for me
was ready, he had affected to submit to defeat. This
was to learn precisely how matters were on the <i>Rampallo</i>,
and the steps necessary to secure the freedom
of his companions.</p>

<p>He had gulled me so completely that I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
within an ace of giving him the authority to the
skipper, which would have sent the <i>Stella</i> racing off
to bring the men back to the city, while I was kept a
prisoner.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had pulled up in time to checkmate
that move, and thus was still so far master of the
position.</p>

<p>What would be Barosa&#8217;s next step? What did he
mean to do with me? It would not do him much good
to keep me a prisoner. Nor, so far as his conspiracy
was concerned, would he gain anything even by
knocking me on the head or putting a bullet in it.</p>

<p>I had rubbed the fact in well that, if anything
happened to me, there were others who would give
the information which would blow his plans into the
air and send him flying for his life. There was a
certain amount of grim satisfaction that I was worth
more to him alive than dead; and in my present
plight any consolation at all was welcome.</p>

<p>There was another source of consolation, too.
Bryant knew where I was, and when I did not return
to him he would do something. He was a sharp
fellow, and quite shrewd enough to make matters
unpleasant for my gaolers. Fortunately, I had told
him that I was coming to the house in search of
Miralda; and as he knew about Barosa and the
attempt the latter and Henriques had made, he would
soon scent danger.</p>

<p>He would be in a desperate fix, however, what to
do and when to do it; urged, on the one hand, to
immediate action by his alarm for me, but restrained
on the other by fear of acting too soon and so interfering
with my plans. But I might safely reckon
that he would not let many hours pass without taking
some vigorous measures on my behalf. In that
case I might still escape without any more serious
trouble than those hours of discomfort.</p>

<p>Barosa was ignorant of the fact that Bryant knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
of my presence in the house, and thus would not
have the very strong incentive to hurry matters
which that knowledge would have given him. If
my guess was right&mdash;that his object was to force
me to send an order to Captain Bolton to go after the
<i>Rampallo</i> and set the prisoners at liberty&mdash;he would
be chary of doing me any injury which would prevent
my sending for them.</p>

<p>I had reached that point in my speculations when
the door was unbolted, and two or three persons
entered. They carefully examined the cords on my
arms, and then hauled me to my feet, and half led,
half carried me up several flights of stairs to a room
where the gag and cloth over my head were taken off.</p>

<p>I found myself in a small room, the one window of
which was barred. A pallet bed stood in one corner
with a mattress, but without sheets or blankets, and
by the window a chair and a small table with writing
materials on it.</p>

<p>I lay down on the bed, intensely glad to be able to
breathe freely once more, but both sick and dizzy
from the pressure of the gag. I recognized the men
who had brought me upstairs. I had seen them on
the night of the &#8220;test,&#8221; and I judged that they had
been intentionally selected by Barosa in order that
I might see I was in the hands of men who would
have scant mercy for a traitor.</p>

<p>He meant to play on my fears, and the writing
materials ready to hand showed me I had guessed
his purpose. I was to be forced to write the necessary
instructions to the skipper.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken by the men. As soon as
they had finished with me they went outside, leaving
the door open and remained close to it.</p>

<p>Some few minutes passed, and then Barosa came
into the room and closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Donnington, you must understand
what we require you to do,&#8221; he said very peremptorily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
&#8220;You have chosen to interfere in our plans, and your
interference has brought you to this pass. You are
absolutely in our power; and I tell you at once and
frankly, that your life will depend upon your decision.
You will write the instructions to Captain Bolton to
go after the <i>Rampallo</i>, and take our friends to Oporto
with all speed. As soon as they are safe, you shall
be set at liberty. Not here in Lisbon; but you will
go on board a steamer which will take you straight
back to England, and you will have to give your
word of honour not to speak a word of anything you
know until you reach your country. You will also
order your captain to take your yacht straight to
England the moment that our friends are landed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do nothing of the sort, Dr. Barosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will change your mind. The penalty
of refusal will be&mdash;death,&#8221; he replied, as sternly and
impressively as he could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I refuse absolutely,&#8221; I said, in quite
as firm a tone as his. As a matter of fact, I did not
believe in his threat. His object was to get his friends
at liberty with the least trouble and in the quickest
time, and he was bluffing me.</p>

<p>But if it was only bluff, he made it very realistic.
&#8220;I shall give you five minutes in which to do what
I require, and at the end of that time if you persist
in your refusal you shall die. That I declare solemnly
on my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he called in a couple of men and ordered
them to unfasten my right hand and bind my left arm
to my side, and as soon as they had done so, he sent
them out again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you what you do not seem to know.
The attempt last night on the king has become
known, many arrests have been made, and we are
all in danger of the same fate. At present the men
who have brought you up here do not know the part
you have played in betraying them; but when they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
learn it you know enough of them to judge how they
will feel towards you, and what they will be eager
to do in revenge. If on my return in five minutes
from now those instructions are not written, I shall
tell them everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he went out, leaving me extremely perplexed
and profoundly uncomfortable. Every one
knows the trying effect of suspense on one&#8217;s nerves;
and he had no doubt carefully calculated how it would
act upon mine.</p>

<p>Did he mean to make his threat good, or was it
a blank cartridge? I did not believe that the attempted
abduction had been discovered, and that
statement of his threw doubt on everything else.
Moreover, he had told and acted lie after lie in the
former interview, and had done so cleverly enough
to hoodwink me completely.</p>

<p>He had declared on his honour that he was in
earnest now, and his manner had been tremendously
earnest. But a man who could lie as he had would
probably not hold his word of honour much more
highly than his word without such a pledge. So I
put that aside as a mere touch of play-acting.</p>

<p>As I thought it all over, it seemed to me that he
had overplayed his part. If he had meant to shoot
me, that reference to his associates founded, as I
believed it to be, on a lie about the plot having been
discovered, was an unnecessary exaggeration of my
danger, intended to appeal to my fears.</p>

<p>Yet, if I were wrong, my shrift was to be a very
short one. To form a judgment on a man&#8217;s probable
motives, when the penalty of a mistake means death,
is a very ugly task, and I seemed to have scarcely
begun to think when he came back.</p>

<p>I was still sitting on the bed and a glance at the
paper showed him it was blank.</p>

<p>&#8220;You persist in refusing, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had time to decide.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;I won&#8217;t give you any longer,&#8221; he said, very sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one point you must clear up. About
Mademoiselle Dominguez,&#8221; I said firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will answer you with your own words this
morning. It is for me, not you, to impose conditions.
But her safety will be secured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you can have my decision. As soon as she
and I are across the frontier, you can have the letter
you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you will not write it otherwise? I
warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean I will not write it otherwise,&#8221; I replied;
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you hanged first. Do what you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He called in the three men who were waiting at
the door, and in a very few words told them the part
I had taken on the previous night, and that I intended
to betray everything I knew to the authorities.</p>

<p>Before he had half finished there was no question
about their verdict. I read it in faces dark and
fierce as a cyclone cloud; in the threatening looks
from eyes ablaze with wrath; in the execrations
hissed and growled between teeth clenched fast in
hate, and in the gleam of the half-drawn weapons
as the strenuous fingers clutched at them instinctively.</p>

<p>White-hot with passion they were, and possessed
with but one common motive and resolve&mdash;to defend
themselves by exacting the uttermost penalty for my
treachery. Jury and judges and executioners in
one, Barosa knew how to play upon their feelings,
and I saw that I was condemned and sentenced
almost as soon as the first words had left his lips.</p>

<p>They were some of those who had been suspicious
of me when the &#8220;test&#8221; of my good faith had been
made, one of them being the young fellow who on
that night had endeavoured to draw a statement
from me by pretending that he had been arrested and
had turned informer. He was the most vindictive
of them all now; and while Barosa was still speaking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
he broke in with a loud fierce oath, and, carried away
by his rage, he drew his revolver and fired point-blank
at my head.</p>

<p>Barosa saw him and struck up his arm. &#8220;Marco!&#8221;
he thundered. &#8220;Are you the sole judge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dog shall die,&#8221; he growled, in a muttered
snarl of hate; and the other two scowlingly agreed
with fierce and savage oaths.</p>

<p>Barosa turned on them, his eyes snapping with
rage. &#8220;Do you follow your own lead or mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall die,&#8221; said Marco sullenly, and was raising
his revolver again when Barosa snatched it from
him and flung it to the ground.</p>

<p>All three quailed before his fierce look and masterful
assertion of his leadership; and Marco fell back a
couple of paces, his gaze at me more vengeful and
bitter than before, as if I had been the cause of his
humiliation.</p>

<p>I could understand Barosa&#8217;s action. With men
of this class among his followers his rule must be
absolute and inflexible. Independent action, even
when amounting to no more than an anticipation of
his orders, could only be fraught with danger in such
a cause as his; and for his own sake and that of the
end he had in view, he was bound to exact literal
and implicit obedience.</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was dead silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, is it my lead or yours?&#8221; he asked them.</p>

<p>There was no longer sign or sound of disobedience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pick up your weapon, Marco.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young fellow obeyed and put it back in his
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now your decision?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Death,&#8221; all three exclaimed together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bind his free hand,&#8221; he ordered next.</p>

<p>But I was not going to submit tamely. I sprang
to my feet and seized the chair. If I was to die it
should be in hot blood, not like a sheep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>&#8220;Resistance is useless, Mr. Donnington. You
must see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>My reply was not in words. I swung the chair
up&mdash;it was a stout heavy wooden one&mdash;and struck
at him with all my force. He jumped back and
escaped most of the blow, but one of the legs struck
him on the side of the head; and then a very hot
five minutes followed. I laid the young fellow,
Marco, senseless, and gave the other two something
to remember me by before the chair was torn out of
my grip, and I was seized and my right arm bound
to my side and my legs lashed together.</p>

<p>Barosa had kept carefully out of the fight, but
as soon as I was helpless he saw that the cords were
tied very securely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand him against the wall there,&#8221; he said, indicating
a spot at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>They placed me as directed and then drew back.</p>

<p>He stooped over Marco, who was only stunned for
the moment, drew the revolver from his pocket and
handed it to one of the men. &#8220;You have yours,&#8221;
he said to the other.</p>

<p>The fellow drew it out with a swift under glance at
me, full of sinister thirst for revenge and gloating
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Then Barosa looked across at me. &#8220;We are all
agreed that this is our only course, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>I met his look firmly. &#8220;You can murder me if
you will, but it will not help you. You know that,&#8221;
I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you write what I require?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said sharply to the others.</p>

<p>They looked to see that the revolvers were loaded,
glanced at each other and raised them slowly, pointing
them at my head and waiting for the word to fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you one last chance, Mr. Donnington,&#8221;
said Barosa.</p>

<small>MIRALDA&#8217;S APPEAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHETHER I was really so near death as it
appeared when the two pistols were levelled
close to my head and the men were waiting for the
word to fire, or whether it was no more than a well-played
and realistically-staged bluff to frighten me
into writing the instructions to Captain Bolton, I
have never been able to decide. I think now, it was
only pretence from beginning to end; but I believed
it was grim earnest then, and that when I answered
Barosa&#8217;s question with another refusal, I was signing
my own death-warrant.</p>

<p>But in the pause before he gave the order to fire
there was a sound of rapid footsteps on the stairs,
and Inez rushed into the room. With a cry of horror
she dashed between me and the levelled weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; she asked Barosa.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see for yourself,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall not do this in my house. Lower your
pistols, you,&#8221; she cried to the men.</p>

<p>They looked to Barosa, who hesitated a second,
and then signed to them to leave the room.</p>

<p>At that moment the strain told on me. I turned
dizzy and weak, and sat, or rather slid, down on to
the foot of the bed, and lolled helplessly against the
wall.</p>

<p>An angry altercation followed between Inez and
Barosa, but I paid no attention to it. I could not;
and some minutes passed before I was able to pull
my wits together sufficiently to hear what passed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Barosa was about to leave the room. &#8220;The responsibility
is yours, not mine,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;I
tell you that while that man is alive, not one of us is
safe. You know how the police are hunting for us.
They will come here to a certainty, and then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
and he threw up his hands angrily and went out.</p>

<p>Inez sat down and leaned her head on her hand in
thought, and presently turned and looked at me,
with a deep despairing sigh.</p>

<p>The interval gave me time to think. It was beginning
to dawn upon me that the whole thing was
play-acting, and that Inez herself had had her cue to
enter for her part in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington?&#8221; she began at length.</p>

<p>I turned very slowly and looked at her. For the
present it was evidently my best course to lead her
to think that I had no suspicion of the unreality of
the proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave a feeble smile and wagged my head slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you listen to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I&mdash;I thank you,&#8221; I said, in a half-indistinct
mumble, and with a sigh as heavy as hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is horrible,&#8221; she replied with a shudder. &#8220;But
they shall not do you any harm. If I could get you
out of the house I would. Oh, why, why have you
done all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe you my life,&#8221; I said, inconsequently.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can save you,&#8221; she cried. After a pause
she jumped up and began to pace the floor excitedly.
&#8220;You are mad to set Barosa at defiance. You must
see the uselessness, the folly of it, the utter madness.
The whole city is up in anger against us. We are
in hourly danger of discovery, even here in this house.
There is nothing left for any of us but flight; and
you choose such a moment to drive him to extremes;&#8221;
and she continued in this half-distracted manner, as
if speaking partly to me and partly to herself, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
giving me a very vivid picture of their desperate
situation.</p>

<p>But it did not agree with what Barosa had said.
He had declared that if I gave the order for the officers
on the <i>Rampallo</i> to be set at liberty, I was to be set
free on their arrival. That meant a delay of nearly
two days, and was therefore absolutely inconsistent
with Inez&#8217; statement that they were in hourly danger
of the police raiding the house.</p>

<p>However, her long excited tirade gave me time to
think things out; and when at last she ended with an
appeal to me to write what Barosa required, I had
decided how to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me to have these men set at liberty,
contesse; but if I were to do so, what object would
be gained, as everything has been discovered?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are our friends and we must save them.
Their ruin will not help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miralda is my friend, and I must save her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will not help her by destroying them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is Miralda kept a prisoner here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not a prisoner, Mr. Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she was not allowed to leave the house this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because after she had seen you we learnt other
facts about her danger. She is not a prisoner, and
she stayed because it was not safe for her to leave
the house. That is all. You persuaded her to consent,
but when I saw her afterwards she realized her
mistake in having given you the promise. She will
tell you so herself. She is as anxious as I am that you
should do what Dr. Barosa requires.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was all part of her parrot-like lesson, of course,
but it was no use to tell her that I knew that. So I
tried another tack. &#8220;Do you know Major Sampayo&#8217;s
history?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with this?&#8221; she asked in
surprise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>&#8220;A great deal, as I will show you. Do you know
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, except that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything about his South African career, I
mean?&#8221; I broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied, shaking her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221; And I told her enough to
let her understand why he went in such fear of me.
&#8220;That is the secret of Barosa&#8217;s hold over him,&#8221; I
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you tell me this, and at such a time?&#8221;
she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three days ago Sampayo offered to take any oath
I pleased that he would never marry Miralda; and
this morning on the <i>Rampallo</i> he told me he had all
but gone on his knees to Barosa, to induce him to
set Miralda free from all this, in order that I might
be induced to leave the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to understand me now. The catch of
the breath, the dilating nostrils, the quick movement
of the head, and the involuntary gripping of the
hands, were signs as easy to read as print.</p>

<p>&#8220;Within the last hour or two, here in this room,
I offered to write all that he needs if Miralda and I
were put across the frontier. He refused. I asked
myself&mdash;why? I ask you the same question?&#8221;</p>

<p>In the pause she sat gnawing her lip; her bosom
rose and fell quickly under the strain of her quickened
breathing; her colour began to wane; her brows were
drawn together in a frown, and the pupils of those
curious eyes of hers dilated as if her pent-up feeling
had acted upon them like atropine. &#8220;Why do you
tell me this?&#8221; she repeated, her voice down almost
to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning Sampayo swore to me that his
betrothal to Miralda was a sham and a pretence,
never intended to culminate in marriage, but only
meant to cover another man&#8217;s plans and passion.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;Why do you tell me this?&#8221; she asked, for the
third time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Manoel Barosa is the man you love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She winced as if I had struck her in the face, and
for a few seconds sat speechless and overwrought.
Then with a great effort she mastered her emotion
and laughed. &#8220;It is all false, all ridiculous, all
laughable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why will he not let Miralda go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you we are not preventing her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, stop that pretence. If you will not answer
that question to me, answer it to yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she had regained her self-command, and concealed
all sign of the jealousy I knew I had roused.
&#8220;She shall come to you herself and tell you that
what I say is true,&#8221; she said. She went to the door,
paused, and then turned. &#8220;You have done yourself
an ill turn by this. Until now I have been your
friend,&#8221; she said, clipping her words short in her
anger; and with that she went out.</p>

<p>I cared nothing for her anger. I knew that I had
started a fire which would soon rage furiously enough
to burn up Barosa&#8217;s scheme in regard to Miralda.
The question I had told Inez to put to herself was
one to which the roused devil of her jealousy would
soon supply the answer; and when it was answered,
Barosa would have his hands full in looking after
himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, I was now all but convinced that the
whole show of force had been nothing more than an
ingenious and well-acted bluff. Barosa had realized
that without my help he could not get Gompez and
his companions set at liberty, and it was quite
probable that he had been to Captain Bolton. I smiled
as I thought of the reception he would meet with
from the old skipper.</p>

<p>As his dramatic show of force and Inez&#8217; appeal
following her aptly-timed rescue, had both failed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
the next move was to send Miralda. But it was
very long before she came, and the afternoon began
to wane. I watched the fading light with eyes greedy
for the darkness, for I knew that I might then look
for some results of Bryant&#8217;s action.</p>

<p>I was suffering considerable pain now. The cords
which bound my arms to my sides had been so tightly
drawn that all the blood in my body was congested,
and I tossed and turned on the bed in vain efforts to
find relief from the pressure.</p>

<p>All my own worries were forgotten, however, when
Miralda came, and I struggled up into a sitting posture
and greeted her with a smile, as she crossed the room.</p>

<p>Her face was very pale and careworn, her manner
nervous and hesitating, and her eyes very troubled.
She had no smile in answer to mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez tells me that you believe I am a prisoner
here, Mr. Donnington. I have come to assure you
that is not so. I did not return to you this morning
because I found it would be useless for me to attempt
to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this nervously in a sort of monotone, and
with the air of one repeating a lesson and afraid of
forgetting the lines. The very tone contradicted
every syllable; and as she finished, she whispered
hurriedly in English: &#8220;Caution.&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood the position instantly and played up
to it. &#8220;I told you there was no danger. You might
have trusted me,&#8221; I replied aloud in a tone of reproach;
and then with a glance toward the door
which she had left wide open, I whispered in English:
&#8220;Listening?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded quickly, and said in her own tongue:
&#8220;You did not know. You could not know. Everything
about last night has been discovered, and the
city is being ransacked to find us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. I am sure that nothing is yet
known of the failure. This is said to frighten you;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
and again I whispered quickly in English: &#8220;Are you
a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she answered with a quick significant nod,
as she went on with her lesson. &#8220;I have come to
beg of you to do what Dr. Barosa wishes. Inez says
you are refusing because you think you can help me.
But you can help me much better by doing this. I
beg you with all my heart not to refuse any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was now able to speak with a much greater
appearance of sincerity and earnestness; and as she
finished this last appeal she whispered in English:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say I can help you better by freeing these
men. Prove that to me, or let others prove it. Do
you know that Dr. Barosa has told me that even if I
yield to him I am to be taken from here on board a
vessel sailing straight for England? How is that to
help you?&#8221; and I laughed incredulously.</p>

<p>Under cover of the sound of my laugh she whispered
&#8220;Brazil, not England,&#8221; and then added, with
a well-acted note of concern in her voice: &#8220;You are
placing me in danger from some of these desperate
men who believe that I am in league with you to
betray them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that cannot be so. No one knows that I
told you anything about the position of things on the
<i>Rampallo</i>,&#8221; and I questioned her with my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you you will ruin me if you persist in refusing,
Mr. Donnington,&#8221; and added under her breath:
&#8220;We were overheard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe that. These people are merely
seeking to frighten you. Of course if I thought you
were really in danger the thing would be altogether
different,&#8221; and again my eyes questioned her.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and shook her head.
&#8220;How can I prove it to you? I am. I know that.
Even Dr. Barosa is alarmed, lest he may not be able
to protect me from their violence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>&#8220;But he has already arranged for your escape and
your mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head again meaningly. &#8220;These men
have made that impossible to-day. We were prevented
when everything was ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more the silent question from me, answered
by the significant shake of her head, told me the real
truth beneath her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what you say only confirms my opinion&mdash;that
by doing what is asked I should not help you,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>Her eyes signalled assent, but her lips uttered a
quite emotional protest. &#8220;Is my safety nothing to
you, then? If I beg and implore you to do what I
have asked; if I tell you, as I do, that my liberty,
and probably my life, depend upon your decision, is
this all nothing to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her look explained the double meaning of her
words. She believed that not only my safety, but
her own, depended upon my doing what she had asked&mdash;but
asked not in words, but by her looks and
whispered English asides.</p>

<p>&#8220;You distress me more than I can say,&#8221; I replied,
adopting a similar equivocation. &#8220;If it were possible
I would tell you precisely how I feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You appear to think you can set these men at
defiance with impunity, and that they will not harm
you or me so long as you refuse!&#8221; A swift interchange
of glances told me that this was actually her
belief. Then she added with passion: &#8220;How can
you be so infatuated, so mad, so reckless? You will
pay for refusal with your life.&#8221; Once more the
significant gesture of the head denied the truth of her
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you have said has moved me deeply.
Heaven knows, I have no thought in all this but to
save you from harm. I must make you understand
that. I have already told Dr. Barosa that if he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
put you and me across the frontier, I will do what
he asks and keep silent about everything. In that
way your safety would be assured. But he refused,
believing that he can force me to agree to his terms.
He cannot. I have so arranged that even if he took
my life&mdash;as indeed he all but did to-day&mdash;he cannot
tear his companions from my grip, and will have to
answer for my murder in addition to these other
charges. There are two beside myself who know
everything about last night&#8217;s attempt&mdash;they helped
me in it&mdash;and they will hand over the prisoners I
took. Aye, and more than that. They know of his
hatred of me; and should anything happen to me
they will not rest until they have hunted him down
and avenged me. No; it is useless to plead longer,&#8221;
I exclaimed, as if she had been going to do so, while
in fact she had listened with mounting interest and
pleasure to every word.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I must,&#8221; she broke in, taking the cue readily.
&#8220;I beg&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot listen to you. I have stated my terms.
The moment you are out of the country, or on my
yacht and in safety, I will do what is wanted; but
until then neither entreaties nor threats shall make
me yield.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave me a last bright glance of encouragement,
her heart in her eyes, and then burying her face in
her hands she cried despairingly: &#8220;You do not care,
you do not care. You will ruin us all in your madness;&#8221;
and as if overwhelmed by her emotions, she
rushed out of the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />


<small>JEALOUSY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE interview with Miralda left me in better
spirits than I had been at any moment since
my imprisonment. She had confirmed my own view
that my life was safe so long as I refused to release
Gompez and his companions, and had assured me that
she herself was in no serious or immediate danger.</p>

<p>But best of all she had given me another proof
of her trust. A fresh bond was created between us and
the old one cemented more firmly than ever. Despite
the fact that those who had sent her to induce me to
yield were actually listening to every word that passed,
she had contrived to let me know the real truth of
the position.</p>

<p>I could understand the pressure which had been
applied to force her to come on such an errand. Her
manner when she entered and uttered the first lines of
the part in which she had been carefully drilled had
revealed her feelings; and the nervous, quickly
whispered word of warning told me why she had
yielded.</p>

<p>She knew the risk she was running should her act
be discovered, but she had faced it unflinchingly for
my sake, resolved to put me on my guard let the
consequences be what they might to her. Barosa and
Inez had little dreamt that the trick of forcing her to
try and mislead me would result in the strengthening
of my resistance! And it was Miralda&#8217;s own shrewdness
and care for me which had brought it all about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>The thought was infinitely sweet; and all the
discomfort and pain I was enduring were forgotten in
the delightful contemplation of Miralda&#8217;s courage
and zeal for me.</p>

<p>The discomfort would soon be over now, moreover.
Many hours had passed since Bryant saw me enter the
house, and I was certain that he was now at work
to secure my liberation.</p>

<p>If I had not been blinded in the morning by my
alarm for Miralda I should have taken the precaution
to tell him what steps to take. But I had not thought
there would be any danger in Inez&#8217; house. I ought
to have foreseen that she would send for Barosa, and
have given Bryant definite instructions what to do if
I did not return to him.</p>

<p>What was he likely to do? He would keep a watch
on the house of course. He would thus see Barosa
arrive, and probably also the men who must have been
sent for afterwards. I read the thing in this way.
Inez had sent word to him almost as soon as I was in
the house. He had come at once and then had
probably sent Miralda to me in order to overhear
what passed between us.</p>

<p>Recognizing the danger, he had then sent for such
of his companions as he could thoroughly trust and
had laid the trap into which I had fallen. But he saw
that unless he could get the men on the <i>Rampallo</i>
free, I still held the key to the situation. He had
tried first to trick me with that pretence of submission,
and when that had failed, he had fallen back on threats,
carrying the threat to the very extreme limit in the
hope that I should yield when death appeared the
inevitable alternative.</p>

<p>Then, threats having failed, he resorted again to
cunning. Inez rushed in and saved my life, and then
Miralda had been sent again.</p>

<p>When Bryant saw first Barosa and then the men
arrive, he would be shrewd enough to understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
that I was in danger. In an hour or two he would be
in a parlous fix what to do. Unwilling to leave the
house, lest I should be brought out of it, he would
have to devise some way of getting it watched; and
it was an easy guess that he would solve the difficulty
by finding a messenger of some kind to carry word to
the men on the launch to fetch the skipper.</p>

<p>The question they had to settle was whether they
would enter the house themselves or put the police
on the track. The skipper would be for doing it themselves&mdash;that
was his blunt way; but Bryant&#8217;s was a
much more cautious nature, and he was far more
likely to make up some yarn and set the police to
work.</p>

<p>All this would occupy a lot of time, but I felt
certain that the night would still be young when they
would act.</p>

<p>I lay back on my mattress no longer fretting and
chafing at the slow passage of time. I had ample
food for thought. I pieced together these speculative
doings of Bryant in the intervals of giving rein to the
fresh hopes and new delights engendered by my interview
with Miralda. I recalled word by word all she
had said, treasuring her little asides, her significant
glances, her changes of tone and manner, as jewels
whose every facet reflected her trust, her courage,
and above all her care for me.</p>

<p>I was confident now of success, and it was she
who had given me confidence. As the darkness
deepened I rejoiced. Each minute was bringing
nearer our delivery and reunion.</p>

<p>Some long time after she had left me&mdash;perhaps an
hour or perhaps two hours, I had no means of reckoning
the time, but it had long been quite dark&mdash;I heard
footsteps approaching the room; and I guessed the
curtain was to go up for the next scene.</p>

<p>Barosa and Inez entered together. He carried
a lamp, and I could see by its light that the faces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
of both were very pale. He set the lamp down on
the little table and then bent over me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington!&#8221; he said. His voice was low
and slightly husky, either from suppressed passion
or anxiety.</p>

<p>I made no reply, and when he repeated my name
and shook me I moaned as if in great pain. There
was little enough pretence about it indeed, for the
tightness of my bonds was causing acute suffering.</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes upon him, uttered another moan,
shook my head feebly, and then closed my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is almost unconscious, Manoel,&#8221; said Inez.</p>

<p>I read that use of his name to mean much. She
had been asking herself the question I had suggested&mdash;about
the real reason for detaining Miralda&mdash;and
finding it unanswerable had passed it on to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington!&#8221; he said again angrily.</p>

<p>It was my object to waste time, of course; so I took
no notice except to sigh heavily, open my eyes again
and close them instantly as if the effort tried my
strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not so bad as all that,&#8221; he said, and
shook me again very roughly. When this had no
effect, he felt my pulse, and in doing so put a finger
under the rope which bound my left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how swollen the hands are, Manoel,&#8221; said
Inez, holding the lamp close to me. &#8220;It must be
torture.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Barosa knew better than to be taken in by my
malingering. &#8220;He can speak well enough as he is if
he pleases. Mr. Donnington, we have come to set you
at liberty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then why didn&#8217;t he do it, was my natural thought.
But I went through another little pantomime. I
showed slightly more strength this time, as if invigorated
by the news, but sank back again exhausted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is only shamming, curse him,&#8221; muttered
Barosa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>&#8220;These cords are cruelly tight, Manoel. Ease them,
and see the effect. I&#8217;ll go and fetch some brandy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went away and Barosa began to unfasten the
knots. He was very suspicious and went to work
cautiously. But he need not have feared. The
instant the cords were released and the stagnant
blood began to course again through the veins, I was
not only helpless but in positive agony, from my
aching head to my throbbing feet.</p>

<p>Inez had been back some time before I could bear to
move and when I strove to sit up in order to take
the spirit she had fetched, I fell back like a log, sick,
dizzy and as helpless as a new-born babe. Barosa
held me up while she poured a little brandy between
my chattering teeth.</p>

<p>The pain subsided slowly and the brandy stimulated
me, and after a long interval&mdash;I made it long enough
to try Barosa&#8217;s patience sorely&mdash;I struggled to a sitting
posture.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this you have told Contesse Inglesia?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>I passed my hand across my forehead and stared
at him vacantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know well enough what I mean. Repeat it
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; I muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Mademoiselle Dominguez. Some lie Major
Sampayo is said to have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked from him to Inez, and met her eyes fixed upon
me intently. &#8220;Tell me,&#8221; I said to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Major Sampayo said about the reason why
Miralda was betrothed to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I turned slowly to Barosa. &#8220;If the contesse has told
you, why bother me about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat it,&#8221; he said sternly.</p>

<p>I shook my head. &#8220;You know already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat it,&#8221; he cried again furiously. &#8220;And then
admit you lied.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;I do not lie,&#8221; I answered and turned again to
Inez. &#8220;So you have asked that question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Repeat it, I say,&#8221; he thundered. &#8220;If you
dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I dare. Sampayo told me that you had him
at your mercy because you found out the facts about
his South African doings and threatened to expose
him. I had the same knowledge with an addition
which frightened him even more. He said that you had
forced this betrothal, but that it was only a sham
and that you did not mean him to marry Miralda
because you yourself loved her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out came a storm of oaths and denial, with fierce
and passionate threats against Sampayo for having
coined the lie and against me for having dared to
repeat it.</p>

<p>Inez was scarcely less moved; and from what
passed it was clear that there had been a very warm
quarrel between them before they had come up to me.
I learnt that she had threatened to sacrifice everything
and go straight to M. Volheno.</p>

<p>It was a long time before I could get a word in, and
then I brought them back to the real point. &#8220;Sampayo
told me that after my interview with him he
begged you to get rid of me by doing what I wanted&mdash;freeing
Miralda from all this trouble. But you refused
and tried to get rid of me in another way&mdash;by inciting
Henriques to murder me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie, a lie. It is all lies,&#8221; he exclaimed
furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, why have you kept Miralda in the toils?
If Sampayo lied, what is the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>That roused Inez again, and another altercation
followed, fiercer even and more prolonged than the
first. He had evidently tried to answer the question
with fifty subtle pretexts, but Inez was jealous and
knew too much not to be able to see that there was no
reason except the true one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>In their anger they let out other valuable facts.
The plot to abduct the king had not been discovered,
and Miralda had been prevented from flying on the
pretext that no discovery was likely to be made and
that she would be wanted for the next scheme which
might be hatched. My arrival with the news that I
could reveal the whole conspiracy and meant to do so
had cut even this ground from under Barosa&#8217;s feet,
and then my repetition to Inez of Sampayo&#8217;s story
had completed his discomfiture.</p>

<p>I was delighted to find that Inez was now as anxious
as I was that Miralda should fly the country; and
instead of making her my enemy, as she had declared,
she was resolved that I should take Miralda away.</p>

<p>Barosa was equally determined that I should do
nothing of the kind, and hence the bitterness of both
and the <i>impasse</i> to which matters were brought.</p>

<p>Another result of the quarrel was that it gave me
time to recover my strength, and as that increased,
I began to see whether I could not take advantage of
the position to escape. I was more than a match for
Barosa even after my experiences in that room. It
was probable that he had a revolver on him, and if I
could get that, I could soon put a different complexion
on matters.</p>

<p>But he and Inez had crossed to the other end of the
room, she had closed the door lest the sound of their
angry voices should be heard by others in the house;
and I could not get to him, however quick my rush,
before he would have time to draw his weapon.</p>

<p>In his present frenzy he would shoot me the instant
he drew, and things were going too favourably for
me to take that risk.</p>

<p>I waited therefore in the hope that he would return
to my end of the room and give me the chance I
sought.</p>

<p>But before I had such a chance, some one knocked
hurriedly at the door and Marco rushed in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>&#8220;I must speak to you at once,&#8221; he said excitedly
to Barosa, and the two men went out together.</p>

<p>Inez was literally convulsed with jealous rage. Her
face was white, her features drawn and haggard, her
hands fiercely clenched, and she was shaking from
head to foot. As the two men went out, she watched
Barosa, her strange eyes gleaming like those of a
tigress watching her prey. And when the door closed
behind them, she crossed to me, her hand pressed
tightly to her heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get Miralda from this house or I will not answer for
myself,&#8221; she said, her lips shivering and her voice low
and hoarse with passion.</p>

<p>I threw up my hands with a gesture of helplessness.</p>

<p>With fingers that shook so violently that she could
scarcely command them, she tore open the bosom of
her dress, took out a revolver and thrust it into my
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait here a few minutes until I return. She
shall be ready to go,&#8221; she whispered and then turned
to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Inez! Quick. For God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; cried Barosa;
and the next moment I was alone again.</p>

<p>I rose and paced the room to shake off the lingering
effects of the cramp caused by the cords. My legs
were still stiff, but a few turns across the room put
me all right.</p>

<p>Presently I opened the door and stood listening
for Inez&#8217; return. Although I was within a few minutes
of complete success, I was in a fever of impatience.</p>

<p>There was no sound anywhere in the house, and
it was all dark. I fetched the lamp from my room and
went to the stairhead.</p>

<p>Was it after all nothing but some fresh ruse?</p>

<p>I examined the revolver Inez had given me. It was
loaded.</p>

<p>I was mystified.</p>

<p>I began to descend the stairs, but paused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>If I carried a light I should be an easy mark for
any one having a fancy to make a target of my body.</p>

<p>Setting the lamp down I felt my way by the balustrade
and crept down in the dark, careful to make as little
noise as possible and halting every now and again to
listen.</p>

<p>In this way I descended two storeys, and tried
in vain to remember how many flights I had been
carried up, that I might know on which floor I stood.</p>

<p>Feeling in my pockets I found my matches and was
about to strike one when I heard a footstep followed by a
smothered exclamation, as if some one had stumbled
in the dark. The sound came from some distance
below.</p>

<p>Instinctively I shrank back against the wall and
stood holding my breath and listening intently.</p>

<p>All was as still as a vault.</p>

<p>My eyes had now grown sufficiently accustomed to the
dark to enable me to make out that I was on a
wide landing on to which several rooms opened. I
felt my way round and listened cautiously at each.
Not a sound. Two of the doors were ajar, but each
of the rooms was in darkness.</p>

<p>I hesitated when I reached the stairs again what to
do. That stumbling footstep below had been full
of unpleasant suggestion. But it was useless to stop
where I was, so I continued my descent, more
cautiously and slowly than before.</p>

<p>When I reached the next floor I paused again,
waiting a long time and straining my ears for some
clue to the baffling situation. Not hearing a sound, I
again made a circuit of the landing, feeling my way
by the wall. There were three doors here, and each
was ajar, and all three rooms in darkness.</p>

<p>Feeling my way back to the stairs, I stumbled
against a low pedestal placed at some little distance
from the wall. There was a large plant on it and in
preventing it from falling, the leaves shook with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
rustling noise almost disconcerting in the dead stillness
of the house.</p>

<p>I crouched as still as a statue behind it, listening
and holding my breath again. Then I heard other
rustling with a curiously regular beat or infinitesimal
throbbing. For a long time this puzzled me; until
at length I discovered that the throbbing was that of
my own heart and the rustling due to the movement
of my coat lapel against the stiff edge of my collar.</p>

<p>I crept on then to the stairs and descended, still
using the same caution. I reached the bottom. I
was now in the hall. The feel of the marble under my
foot told me this.</p>

<p>I remembered the direction of the front door and
turned toward it.</p>

<p>But I had not taken two steps in its direction before
I was seized, a hand was pressed on my mouth before
I could utter a sound, and my hands were wrenched
back violently and pinioned behind me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br />


<small>A NIGHT OF TORMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY first thought when I was seized so suddenly
in the darkness was that a fresh trap had
been laid for me and that I had blundered into it;
and that all the fierce wrangling between Inez and
Barosa in my presence had been mere pretence, to lead
up to her saying what she had about my leaving the
house with Miralda.</p>

<p>But why all that trouble had been taken when I
was already in their power and, above and beyond all,
why she should have given me a loaded revolver, was
utterly baffling.</p>

<p>I had not more than a minute or two to worry over
that, however, for my captors dragged me in silence
to a room close by, which, like the rest of the house,
was in darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak above a whisper,&#8221; said one of them
fiercely, putting his lips close to my ear.</p>

<p>An electric lamp was flashed in my face and the
sudden light set me blinking and winking like an owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221; asked a voice out of the
darkness.</p>

<p>A murmur of dissent from the rest followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the rest of you?&#8221; was the first question
asked of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean,&#8221; I replied after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer my question at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was at my wits&#8217; end to know what line to take. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
had had such dramatic proof of Barosa&#8217;s methods of
testing my good faith, that the suspicion flashed across
me that this was just another of them. He and Inez
might have patched up their quarrel&mdash;if it had been
one in reality&mdash;and he might have devised this means
of seeing whether I meant to keep my promise of silence,
before he allowed Miralda to leave the house with me.</p>

<p>My hesitation appeared to provoke the man who
had put the question. &#8220;Answer at once, you dog,&#8221;
he said. But whether his anger was real or assumed,
I could not tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is some mistake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find that out if you don&#8217;t answer at once,&#8221;
he broke in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an Englishman, Ralph Donnington, and have
been kept a prisoner in this house since this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me instantly,&#8221; he repeated with an oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given you the only answer I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lamp was directed at my face the whole time&mdash;the
only gleam of light in the whole room. And to me
everything was, of course, just one huge blur of utter
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You refuse to tell me? You will repent it, I warn
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have answered,&#8221; I said again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say you were a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you come to the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This morning. I came here from my yacht, the
<i>Stella</i>. She is in the river now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who made you a prisoner, and why?&#8221;</p>

<p>To answer that involved the telling of all I knew.
And whether this was sham or reality, it meant danger
to Miralda. &#8220;You may be sure I mean to find that
out,&#8221; I said, fencing.</p>

<p>A pause followed and I heard some whispering.
Then the man&#8217;s former question was repeated. &#8220;You
say you were a prisoner?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A prisoner at liberty to roam about the house
armed with a loaded revolver? Is that what you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some little time ago a woman came to me&mdash;I was
locked in a room at the top of the house&mdash;and gave
me the revolver and told me I could leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the truth; but it sounded like a preposterous
lie&mdash;as the truth sometimes will.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that was just at the moment when you were
all hurry-scurrying for your lives on our arrival. Of
course you don&#8217;t know who the woman was, any more
than why you came sneaking down the stairs in the
pitch darkness with her revolver ready to put a bullet
into any one who prevented your escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I tell you is absolutely true. I was trying
to get away, of course, and came down in the dark
fearing some trick on the part of those who had imprisoned
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know whose house this is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. The Contesse Inglesia&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh come, you know something,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;I
suppose she is a friend of yours&mdash;just in a social way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was presented to her at the house of the Marquis
de Pinsara just after my arrival in Lisbon. I came
to Lisbon on a mission of considerable importance in
which the Marquis and others of his friends are greatly
interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you include His Majesty the King in your
circle of friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>I disregarded the sneer and replied gravely, &#8220;No,
but I can give you a list of those who are interested
in my affairs;&#8221; and beginning with M. Volheno, I
rattled off a number of names. It was no good having
well-placed acquaintances without making some use
of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are an impudent scoundrel,&#8221; was the hot
reply. &#8220;Why did you come to this house to-day?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>&#8220;On matters closely connected with my object here
in Lisbon.&#8221; This was, of course, my real object&mdash;Miralda&mdash;but
it was not necessary to split hairs or
trouble with too much explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom have you seen here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Contesse Inglesia and the woman who gave
me the revolver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not identify any one else.&#8221; This was
very close to a direct lie; and as I had no intention
of either telling what I knew or of committing myself
to a direct denial, until I was certain about the nature
of the whole proceedings, I added: &#8220;I have said
that I am an Englishman. I have given you my
name and have told you I am a friend of M. Volheno,
amongst others. You do not believe what I say, and
I claim my right as a British subject to communicate
with my country&#8217;s representatives here in the capital.
Let me send to them or yourselves send to M. Volheno.
I shall not answer any more questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me at once where to find the rest of your
companions,&#8221; he said very sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know no more than yourself. I have no other
answer to give.&#8221; I spoke very firmly and half expected
that my experience of the former test would be
repeated and that the men would be satisfied.</p>

<p>But nothing of the kind followed. After a pause
the light was suddenly put out, a whispered command
was given, and I was hurried out of the room and then
out of the house, dragged with no little violence into
a carriage and driven away.</p>

<p>This might still be part of a drastic test, of course;
so I held my tongue and let them take me where they
would. As I left the house I glanced about me in the
hope of catching sight of Bryant; and was considerably
troubled when I could not see him.</p>

<p>But I was soon to learn that it was no mere test.
The carriage pulled up before a gloomy building and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
was half led, half dragged inside, where I was confronted
by a number of men in police uniform. I was searched
and everything taken from me; my name was entered;
and without more ado I was led away to be thrust into
an unmistakable prison cell with other equally unmistakable
prisoners.</p>

<p>The experiences of that night live as an ineffaceable
memory&mdash;worse than any nightmare horrors; worse
than one&#8217;s worst imaginings of any nether world.</p>

<p>The cell was a large one in which perhaps twenty
or thirty could have been confined without any undue
crowding. There were more than that number already
there when I was thrust inside; and many others were
brought in afterwards, men and women indiscriminately,
until we must have numbered over sixty altogether.</p>

<p>Had all been approximately clean or approximately
sober, the air would still have been too foul to
breathe and we should have been too crowded to
move without shouldering one another. By the
exercise of strict discipline and mutual arrangement
and forbearance, it would have been possible, by
taking turns, for some to have slept while the
rest huddled together.</p>

<p>But there was neither cleanliness nor discipline.
Most of the men and some of the women were of the
scum of the gutter; filthy beyond description and
evil-smelling to the point of nausea&mdash;the incarnation
of all that is offensive and abominable in humanity.
And to add to the horror, many of the men were in
different stages of drunkenness&mdash;hilarious, quarrelsome,
brutal or obscene, according as the drink developed
their natural or unnatural temperaments. But all
were noisy and equally loathsome.</p>

<p>Some dozen of the men and most of the women&mdash;of
whom there were about fifteen&mdash;were of a better
class. But two or three of the women were too hysterical
from fear to be capable of anything approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
self-command. Their cries and moans of anguish
were heartrending; and their occasional piercing
screams and vehement outbursts of sobbing, not only
added to the general din and racket, but provoked
the anger of the drunkards and drew from them a
flood of obscenity and abuse.</p>

<p>Wherever a dozen women are brought together in
trouble, however, you may confidently look for at
least one &#8220;ministering angel&#8221; among them. There
were two in that awful den that night. In appearance
they afforded the extremes of contrast. One was a
tall buxom woman in the forties with a hard forbidding-looking
face, but with a heart as stout as her big body
and courage as strong as her bared brawny arms.
The other was a pale frail slip of a girl who looked as
if a breath of wind would have knocked her down;
and it was an act of hers which brought matters to a
crisis.</p>

<p>On my entrance two or three fights were in progress,
and as I had no wish except to avoid trouble, if possible,
I pushed my way to a corner near one of the small
barred windows, and stood leaning against the wall,
watching the unruly crowd in dismay at the prospect
of a night to be passed in such company and in such
utterly foul surroundings.</p>

<p>Whenever the door was opened and fresh prisoners
were thrust in, their entrance was hailed by raucous
shouts of welcome or hoarse oaths and jeers of anger
according to the feelings which the newcomers&#8217; looks
inspired. Those who were known favourably were
hailed by their names, while others were received
with yells and curses and immediately seized and
buffeted and kicked and mauled, dragged hither and
thither like a big bone by a pack of yelping curs, until
bruised, battered and half-dead with fear, they found
rest and obscurity in a corner; or until some new
arrival distracted the attention of their persecutors.</p>

<p>I had been watching one of these affairs when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
turned to find the girl I have mentioned at my side.
Her fragile form and pale face moved my pity, and
I made way so that she could stand just under the
window. She thanked me with a smile, and we
stood thus for a long time, exchanging an occasional
glance.</p>

<p>Later on, one of the noisiest of the hysterical women
drifted our way and the girl instantly left her place
and began to try and comfort the woman. There
must have been magnetism in her touch and eyes,
for the effect was remarkable. The other&#8217;s cries
ceased and her sobbing subsided, and she soon regained
a measure of composure.</p>

<p>She was a good-looking woman and her face attracted
the attention of a drunken brute of a bully who shouldered
his way up and with a coarse oath tried to put his
arm round her waist to kiss her. Without a second&#8217;s
consideration of her own risk, the girl thrust herself
in his way and pushed him back with all her little
strength, and stood guarding the woman like a young
lioness at bay.</p>

<p>The beast swore viciously, glared at her and raised
his hand for a blow; then his look changed, his eyes
blazed with animal passion and he tried to seize her,
swearing he would kiss her instead of the woman.</p>

<p>I shouldered my way to her rescue, but before I
could reach her, the big woman intervened. She
grabbed the brute from behind and dragged him off,
with a voluble torrent of language which, &#8220;ministering
angel&#8221; as she afterwards proved, had very little of
the minister and nothing of the angel in it.</p>

<p>The drunken bully, powerful though he was, had
much difficulty in shaking her off, and by the time
he had succeeded, I had reached the girl and stood in
front of her. Finding a man to deal with and one much
slighter than himself, he elbowed himself clear of the
throng round him and prepared to knock me into the
next world. But I knew how to use my fists and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
did not; and as he struck at me I easily parried the
blow and gave him an undercut on the jaw which
sent him staggering back, a very much surprised
bully indeed.</p>

<p>A fight being a welcome recreation for the prisoners,
we were immediately surrounded by a yelling, oathing
crowd, and a sufficient space was cleared for us to settle
matters. It is no credit to batter a half-drunken man,
and I would gladly have avoided the thing if it had
been possible. But it was not. My antagonist was
regarded as a sort of champion by those who knew
him; and as they were anxious to see me mauled,
they hounded him on with shouts and cheers of encouragement.
Five minutes finished it; and established
a reputation for me which proved of infinite value
for the rest of that terrible night.</p>

<p>His friends led him away to the other end of the
place; and when I turned to go back to my corner, I
found that the girl and her big companion had taken
possession of it for the benefit of the other women.
They had cleared a sufficient space to enable the
women to lie down; and by some magic of womanhood
had comforted and soothed them until comparative
quiet had been restored.</p>

<p>Nor was that all. Such of the men as were sober
and decent had drifted to our end and stood in line
as a guard over the women. A space of very few feet
divided us from the rowdies; and as they still persisted
in keeping up a racket, I determined to use the authority
with which my victory had invested me, to try and
stop some of the din.</p>

<p>I picked out three of the strongest men near me, told
them what I meant to do, and asked their help. We
were, of course, heavily handicapped in numbers; but we
were sober and capable of concerted action, whereas
the others were mostly drunk and at loggerheads even
with one another.</p>

<p>Four of us crossed the dividing line and without a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
word seized four of the noisiest of the crowd, dragged
them from the midst of the throng, shook and cuffed
them soundly, and then ordered them to stop their
yelling and oathing.</p>

<p>They slunk off cowed and beaten; but a number
of the others broke out with volleys of curses and
threats and showed fight. At this, the other men
from my corner came forward, and the man&#339;uvre
was repeated on a larger scale. This time I took care to
punish my man severely; and when we shoved them
reeling away and looked for fresh ones, we looked in
vain.</p>

<p>They all backed away, huddled together like sheep
frightened by the dogs; and for the rest of the night
there was no recurrence of the row. We went back
to our side and resumed guard over the women; half
our number crouched on the ground and the rest of us
did sentry work.</p>

<p>The rowdies across the dividing line gave very little
trouble after that. There were occasional wranglings
among themselves, as they fought for room to crouch
or lie down, or struggled for space to breathe; but they
had had their lesson and were careful not to provoke
another attack from us.</p>

<p>Many of them were soon fast in drunken sleep, as
their stertorous breathing and loud snoring evidenced.
But contrasted with the din and racket in the past
hours, this was comparative peace and silence.</p>

<p>How any one could sleep under such conditions
baffled me. The reek and noisome stench of the place
were appalling; and although I stood as near as I
could get to one of the windows, I was almost suffocated
and felt sick, stifled, and overpowered.</p>

<p>The women also slept, all but the two who watched
over them and tended them with the care and vigilance
of tender-hearted womanhood. The endurance of the
young girl was as wonderful as her staunch courage
and her magnetic handling of her troubled sisters.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
She even outlasted the big brawny woman who fell asleep
soon after the dawn broke. The light struggled through
the windows, and the abject wretchedness and squalor
of the scene were infinitely more depressing and horrible
in the light than they had seemed in the feeble rays of
the gas jets.</p>

<p>Only once did she show even a sign of breaking down.
That was about two hours after the dawn when she
was near me and I asked her why she was a prisoner
and spoke in praise of her conduct.</p>

<p>She told me that she was a political prisoner, and
that her real name was Pia Rosada, but she had been
arrested in a different one. She was a keen revolutionary,
goaded into rebellion by the ill-treatment of her
relatives. She was only a suspect; but she knew
much and looked forward to some kind of torture
being employed to force her to turn informer. &#8220;They
may do what they will, I shall tell nothing,&#8221; she said,
her eyes lighting with resolution and dauntless courage&mdash;a
martyr in the making.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry for you,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would die a hundred deaths first,&#8221; she answered.
Then her look changed. Her clear gaze was troubled
and she glanced round at the women. &#8220;Do you think we
have no cause to revolt? Look at these poor creatures;&#8221;
and her eyes filled with tears. But she dashed them
away. &#8220;We cannot afford the luxury of tears,&#8221; she
said hurriedly, and slipped from me to go to one of
her charges who woke and sat up and began to
weep. In a minute she was soothed and comforted
by the touch of those wonderful hands, the glance of
the magnetic eyes, and the soft whisper of the sweet
calming voice.</p>

<p>My thoughts flew to Miralda, and with a shudder of
fear I pictured her in the midst of such a scene of abomination
and desolate misery.</p>

<p>Death was a million times preferable to existence in
such a hell of life as this!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;WAS not without apprehension that, as soon as
the drunkards and rowdies woke up, there would
be some renewal of the night&#8217;s disturbances, with
trouble to follow for the women and for us who had
kept watch over them.</p>

<p>But the anticipation was unfounded. The men
were too ill to make trouble. The fearful atmosphere
they had breathed, combined with the effects of their
intoxication, had sapped alike their strength and their
energy. Listless, sick both in mind and body, crushed
in spirit and utterly downcast, they kept apart from
us and huddled together in a compact companionship
of weary, lifeless, dejected wretchedness.</p>

<p>Several of those at our end of the prison, men and
women alike, were in much the same condition. Daylight
appeared to add to their sufferings, instead of
diminishing it. In the dim gas light they had been
spared the sight of the other&#8217;s condition; but it was
revealed to them now and made them the more conscious
of their own evil plight. The pestilential
atmosphere had also enfeebled them; and the frail
little Pia and her strong helpmate were hard put to
it to keep them from giving way. Many of them
fainted, gasping piteously for air; and Pia asked me
to get the men to help in holding one or two of them up
to the windows that they might breathe fresh air
in place of the pestilence-laden atmosphere of the
gaol.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>The men agreed readily, although themselves
greatly weakened by the night&#8217;s experiences, and I
had just laid down one woman whom a companion
had helped me to revive in this way, when he began
to speak of Pia; praising her courage, her endurance
and her resource.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a little heroine and will be missed by our
friends,&#8221; he said, when I echoed his praises warmly.
&#8220;I hope they can prove nothing against her. How long
have you known her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her for the first time here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is heart and soul in our cause and one of the
staunchest workers and the bravest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What cause is yours, my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right to be cautious; but my cause is
yours, and yours mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this moment Pia touched me on the arm.
&#8220;Will you come and look at this poor soul here?&#8221;
she asked; and as I turned and we bent over a woman
who had fainted, she whispered hurriedly: &#8220;That man
is a spy. Be careful what you say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was astounded. It seemed incredible that any
money, any reward however lavish, could induce a
man to face the horrors of such an inferno as that gaol.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you lift her to the window?&#8221; asked Pia,
seeing my look of incredulity; and she whispered:
&#8220;It is true. I know. Be very careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man helped me hold the unconscious woman
to the air; and when we set her down somewhat
revived, he was at me again, seeking to draw some
compromising admissions from me in response to his
own violent abuse of the Government.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mistaken about me and should not speak
so unguardedly to a stranger even in this place,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should not had I not seen how you sympathize
with our friends here. It is true we have not met
before, and in that sense we are strangers; but a fellowship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>
of suffering in our common cause makes us all
friends&mdash;aye, and more than friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have done has been done for motives of
mere humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they recognize a leader in you&mdash;and I proclaim
myself as devoted a follower as any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no leader of any cause, man. I am an Englishman;
my name is Donnington; and I have been
brought here through the blundering of the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are devils,&#8221; he exclaimed vehemently, and
then tried to lead me into joining in his abuse of them.
But little Pia had put me on my guard, and after a
time he abandoned his efforts and fastened on to
another man, with results I was delighted to see.</p>

<p>The man listened for a while and presently, taking
offence at something which the spy said, answered
hotly; the spy lost his temper and let fall a remark
which others beside the man he was pumping resented.
They closed round him and first thrashed him soundly
and then knocked him across to the other group. The
latter glad to get hold of one of us grabbed hold of him,
and venting on his cowardly body all the rage they
dared not vent on us, they beat and kicked and mauled
him unmercifully, until his screams for help attracted
the attention of the warders and they entered and
dragged him away.</p>

<p>Knowing that he would seek revenge by lying about
us, I got from Pia all the names of the men who had
stood by me during the night, so that when I was out
of my own troubles, I might tell Volheno what had
really occurred.</p>

<p>Soon after that the door was thrown open and several
officials entered. They made a careful note of the
unusual division of the prisoners into the two groups,
and at once ordered the removal of those with whom
we had had the trouble.</p>

<p>While this was going on I went up to the chief official
and told him my name and asked for food for myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
and those remaining. I was famished and parched
with thirst. I had not had even a crust of bread for
twenty-four hours and only the sip of brandy which
Inez had given me.</p>

<p>His reply was an oath and an order to hold my
tongue.</p>

<p>I pointed to the women and asked for food for
them, and the brute raised his hand and struck me
across the mouth.</p>

<p>Mad with rage at this, I sprang on him and pulled
him down, dashing his head against the stone flags.
In a moment half a dozen of his men rushed up and
dragged me off, kicking and mauling me with the
utmost violence, and then put my wrists in irons.</p>

<p>Their leader rose livid with rage. &#8220;You shall have
the lash for this, you traitorous dog,&#8221; he hissed between
his teeth. &#8220;Fling him in the corner there,&#8221; he
ordered. &#8220;The lash shall tear the flesh from your
back for this. Yes, the lash and plenty of it. That
shall be your breakfast. Yes, the lash, the lash;&#8221;
and he repeated this several times, each time with a
fierce and bitter oath, as if gloating in the prospective
treat of seeing my flesh cut to ribbons.</p>

<p>I was flung into the corner, as he had ordered&mdash;the
loathsome spot, reeking with all the filthy abominations
of the vile crew who had passed the night in it&mdash;and
the other prisoners were forbidden to come near
me under penalty of sharing my punishment. But
the door had scarcely closed on them before little Pia
came straight across, with gentle reproaches for my
futile violence and words of sympathy for my trouble.</p>

<p>I tried to send her away, fearing the warders would
return and find she had disobeyed their order; but
she would not go. The skin of my face was broken
slightly where one of the men had kicked me&mdash;only a
graze, for the force of the kick was spent before his foot
touched me; and she insisted upon wiping the few
drops of blood away. Her touch was that of a hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
skilled in healing; and as she did what she could to
cleanse the little wound, her eyes were full of tears
and her face a living mask of pity and sympathy.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_312.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;In a moment half a dozen of his men rushed up<br />
and dragged me off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, go before they return and find you here,&#8221; I
urged her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not you who saved us all from the worst
terrors of this awful night? Shall I desert you now
you have brought this trouble on yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go, please go. You can do me no good and only
harm yourself,&#8221; I begged her; but she would not
go, and was still with me when the men came back to
lead me out.</p>

<p>They seized her at once and, being brutes not men,
handled her with cruel violence. I would have cursed
them in my empty rage had it not seemed like a dishonour
to her, in her calm quiet, almost saint-like
resignation.</p>

<p>We were taken out together into a large quadrangle,
and I caught my breath with a shiver of panic as I
saw on the other side the whipping post surrounded
by a group of men, two of whom held many-thonged,
heavily knotted whips.</p>

<p>We were led across to it and a halt was made, and
the two powerful men with the whips eyed us both
with sinister, half-gloating gaze.</p>

<p>I was ashamed of my cowardice then. Grit my
teeth as I would in a firm resolve to bear the awful
punishment of the lash, I turned cold and sick at the
thought of it. But the frail creature by my side was
utterly unmoved. She was pale, but no paler than
usual, and as calm and unmoved as the whipping post
itself.</p>

<p>To the brutalized ruffians, the tragedy was more
like a pleasant farce.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only two this morning?&#8221; asked one of those
holding a whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;May be more presently,&#8221; replied one of the men
with us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;I want more exercise than this,&#8221; was the growling
answer, uttered with a sort of snarling laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have plenty with this dog. He struck the
captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks as if he had less stomach for his breakfast
than the girl here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The taunt bit like an acid and did more than anything
could have done to revive my drooped courage.</p>

<p>In this coarse way they jested until another prisoner
was brought out from a different cell and tied up for
the lash. I will not dwell on the sickening scene which
followed. I shut my eyes and, had I not been ironed,
would gladly have closed my ears as well to keep out
the awful sound of the poor wretch&#8217;s screams, until
the blessed relief of unconsciousness silenced them.</p>

<p>Pia stood with her hands clasped to her eyes and
her thumbs pressed close to her ears, and did not look
up until the unfortunate victim was carried away,
the blood dripping from his lacerated back making
a gruesome and significant track across the flags.</p>

<p>I thought my flogging would follow immediately;
but it turned out otherwise. We had merely been
made to witness the terrible punishment that our
courage might be broken and our senses racked by
the sight of what was in store for us.</p>

<p>Instead of being triced up to the post, we were led
away into another part of the building; and one of the
men with me explained with a chuckle that such a
number of strokes as I should receive for my offence
could only be ordered by the Governor of the prison
himself.</p>

<p>As we were taken into the room I saw the officer
I had struck, who was addressed as Captain Moros,
in close consultation with a tall, thin, grey-bearded man
in an elaborate uniform decorated with several medals.
This was His Excellency the Governor. He frowned
at me over the rims of his pince-nez; and I perceived
at once that he had been already informed of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
heinous deed, and that the captain had made the case
as black as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the man, I suppose?&#8221; the Governor
asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the captain, and he turned to the
warders by my side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he securely ironed? He is a very desperate
and very dangerous ruffian,&#8221; he added to the Governor.
&#8220;I have ascertained that he nearly killed one of his
fellow-prisoners in the night and instigated an attack
upon another of them this morning;&#8221; and he bent
toward the Governor and whispered to him.</p>

<p>He was describing the incident of the spy&#8217;s mauling,
and he finished in a tone loud enough to reach
me. &#8220;There is no doubt he recognized him and was
at the bottom of the whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he? Is he known to our men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I have made inquiries. He is one of
the most violent revolutionaries in the city. Altogether
a most reckless, dangerous man. I am able to vouch
for all this personally; and there is no doubt he meant
to kill me. I had a most marvellous escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you say the attack was made?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a word of warning. I was watching
as some of the prisoners were taken out of the cell
and he sprang on me suddenly from behind and
tried to throttle me. It took half a dozen men to
drag him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly a very bad case; as bad as it could be.
And the woman, who is she?&#8221; asked the Governor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A political suspect in league with the man. I
have reason to believe that she incited him to attack
me. I had the fellow separated from the rest and
ordered them not to go near him on pain of sharing
his punishment. I really did that as a test to find
out if he had any close associates among them. She
went to him at once in defiance of my orders; and I
find that they are old companions. They acted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
together all the night in a very suspicious manner
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She looks very young and fragile for such a
punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency will see that flagrant disobedience
of our orders such as this woman was guilty of cannot
be passed over. She knew the penalty of disobedience;
and if prisoners find that we can be set at
defiance with impunity, the difficulty of keeping
them in subjection will be very great. I feel that
my sense of duty compels me to press this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that, of course. The doctor had better
examine her to see if she can bear the punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may of course leave that to me,&#8221; was the
reply; and the Governor was quite willing to do it.</p>

<p>A pause followed, and I was waiting to be questioned,
for I had not even been asked my name, when
Pia&#8217;s clear young voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;General de Sama.&#8221;</p>

<p>If a bomb had exploded suddenly in the room it
would not have produced much more astonishment.
The Governor looked up with surprise; the captain
shouted &#8220;Silence her;&#8221; and the two men holding
Pia shook her angrily, one of them clapping a hand
to her mouth. It was evident that none but official
dogs must bark in that place, and for a prisoner to
open her lips was a crime.</p>

<p>I made an effort to explain, but before a couple of
words were out of my lips, I was silenced as Pia had
been.</p>

<p>When the commotion caused by this had subsided,
the Governor addressed me. &#8220;You have attempted
the life of Captain Moros and you are evidently a
very dangerous and desperate man. The punishment
for your crime under the law is death; but your
intended victim has interceded for you and has mercifully
asked that the case shall be dealt with, not as a
capital crime against the law of the land, but as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
offence against the discipline of the prison. As such
I have power to deal with it. It is a very grave
offence, very grave indeed, and the punishment must
be in proportion to its gravity. You will receive
a hundred lashes to be administered twenty strokes
at a time with such intervals between each flogging
as the doctor shall decide. You have every reason
to be grateful to Captain Moros for his leniency. As
for you,&#8221; he added, turning to Pia, &#8220;your case is different,
but I am compelled to uphold the discipline of
the prison. You knew beforehand the punishment
of disobedience. But you are young and may have
been led into this trouble by your evil companion
there. You will receive five strokes with the lash.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he signed to the men to take us away.</p>

<p>I was so dazed, stunned and overwhelmed by the
terrible sentence that even the gloating look of triumph
and malice on Captain Moros&#8217; face failed to
rouse my resentment, as my guards hustled me away.</p>

<small>THE LUCK TURNS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS it turned out, this same paralysis of despair which
fell on me after hearing my terrible sentence
proved the means of saving me. I had tried to explain
who I was and had been silenced, and any
attempt during the proceedings would have failed
in the same way.</p>

<p>But as I was being taken out, my condition of helplessness
led the warders to believe I was too feeble
to offer any sort of resistance, and their hold of me
was very slight.</p>

<p>Just as I reached the door, through which Pia had
already passed, my wits awoke and my energy quickened
in obedience to an instinct of self-preservation.
The Conte de Sama had been one of those to whom
the Marquis de Pinsara had introduced me on the
night of the reception, and the conte had written me
subsequently that his brother, General de Sama, the
Governor of the prison, was anxious to co-operate
with me.</p>

<p>I sprang back from the gaolers&#8217; loose hold of me,
therefore, and darting toward the Governor I rushed
out the words: &#8220;There is a mistake. I am Ralph
Donnington, the Englishman who seeks the Beira
Concessions. Your brother, Conte de Sama&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no chance to finish, for I was collared by the
warders, one of whom silenced me as Pia had been
silenced.</p>

<p>Captain Moros was furious and put himself in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
of the Governor, as if to protect him from my violence
and ordered the men to drag me away instantly.</p>

<p>But I had appealed to a far higher force than the
law&mdash;the cupidity of this Portuguese notable; and
he had heard enough to rouse his fear of losing a chance
of fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; he said quickly to his companion. &#8220;Remain
here with your prisoner,&#8221; he ordered the gaolers;
and then, as if to conceal his personal interest in my
statement, he was shrewd enough to cover it with a
reference to the law. &#8220;If the prisoner is an Englishman,
Captain Moros, as he says, you will see there
may be somewhat serious complications. I must
question him. Have the female prisoner brought
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I sit down?&#8221; I asked abruptly. My legs
were trembling under me and I was feeling faint from
want of food and quite used up. He consented and
a warder placed a chair for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are an Englishman&#8221;&mdash;and he affected to
have forgotten my name, stumbling over it&mdash;&#8220;how
is it I find you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph Donnington is my name. I was arrested
last night by mistake as a political suspect. I passed
the night in this prison, and when Captain Moros
entered it this morning, I told him who I was and asked
him for some food. He ordered me to be silent. I
then asked for some food for the women who were
lying ill from the effects of the awful night we had all
endured. His reply was a blow on the mouth, and
I lost my temper and grappled with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain tried several times to interrupt me with
furious outbursts, but the Governor&mdash;thinking no
doubt of the concessions&mdash;would not let him interfere.</p>

<p>&#8220;If your statement is true, it puts a very different
complexion on the matter. You must see that,
Captain Moros.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pack of lies,&#8221; he declared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>&#8220;All the prisoners heard and saw what passed.
Interrogate them singly and they will corroborate
every word. I have the honour of the friendship of
M. Volheno and I shall appeal to him to do so. I
have requested to be allowed to communicate both
with him and with the representatives of my country,
but no notice has been taken. If your Excellency
will send to M. Volheno, you will be immediately convinced
that I am what I say&mdash;Ralph Donnington, an
Englishman of great wealth, enjoying the friendship
of the Marquis de Pinsara and many other prominent
men in Lisbon, and here for the purpose of acquiring
very valuable concessions in your African Colony.&#8221;</p>

<p>The concessions won hands down, and the victory
extended even to little Pia who had been brought
back and stood listening in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be inquired into, of course,&#8221; said the
Governor after a pause. &#8220;Free the prisoner&#8217;s hands,&#8221;
he added. Then to me: &#8220;Do you know anything
of the girl at your side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will answer for her as for myself. I know
her to be innocent of any wrong, and that she is about
to leave the country. I am indeed interested in
making arrangements for her to do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pia moved restlessly and was about to protest, I
think, so I placed my hand on her shoulder and
looked into her eyes: &#8220;You will bear out what I
say?&#8221;</p>

<p>To deny would compromise me, and that I was
sure she would not do. After a slight pause, she
said simply: &#8220;That is so.&#8221;</p>

<p>At my mention of Volheno&#8217;s name the Governor
had scribbled a line and handed it to a subordinate
who took it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am compelled to protest against this, your
Excellency,&#8221; said the captain at this point. &#8220;And
having made this protest, I will, with your permission,
return to my duties.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>&#8220;The matter has taken a very grave turn, Captain
Moros; you will be good enough to remain until we
know more. This may be serious for you.&#8221; The
subordinate returned then and handed a packet to the
Governor who whispered with him, and sent him away
again. &#8220;I find that you gave your name on being
brought in last night, Mr. Donnington. Here is what
was found upon you. I shall return all except a paper
which I may have to deal with differently. I revoke
both sentences.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was, of course, the confession of Gompez and
the rest. &#8220;May I ask that some of the money may
be used to buy food for the wretched prisoners in
that cell?&#8221;</p>

<p>He granted the request and sent some one away
for the purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have telephoned to M. Volheno, and have no
doubt, from what he says, that all is as you represent.
He desires to see you as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May we go then? I have had no food since
yesterday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is still one formality,&#8221; he replied. He
turned then to Captain Moros and said something
which made the brute go white and set him trembling,
as he protested. But the protest was evidently
unavailing, and after some further words, he rose
and went out at the back of the room. I learnt afterwords
that he was made the scapegoat for my treatment
and dismissed from his position.</p>

<p>Just as this incident ended, the door by which we
had entered opened and another prisoner was brought
in. To my amazement I saw it was Bryant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you recognize any one here, prisoner?&#8221; the
Governor asked him.</p>

<p>Bryant stared all round. &#8220;Only my master, Mr.
Donnington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that the formality, your Excellency?&#8221; I
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>&#8220;M. Volheno said you two were to be confronted,
and I had no option but to do so. You are now at
liberty to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my servant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. I trust you will let this most regrettable
and unintelligible series of mistakes pass out of
your mind. Here are the things taken from you&mdash;the
paper I am sending to M. Volheno. And now,&#8221;
he added, as he offered me his hand; &#8220;I shall be glad
if at some time convenient to yourself you will afford
me an opportunity of discussing with you the matter
in which you so interested my brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pia was at a loss what to do. So I laid my hand on
her arm. &#8220;Come,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she began.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I repeated, more insistently, and she
yielded, leaving the place as if she where walking
in her sleep. But as soon as we were in the street
and the gloomy gates had closed behind us, she paused
to take two or three deep breaths, her face raised
skywards and her eyes shining brightly in rapture,
and then smiled, as if the very air itself were at once
the symbol and the proof of the liberty so unexpectedly
regained.</p>

<p>After that she turned and held out her hand to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are out of prison, Pia, but you are not free,&#8221;
I said, shaking my head. &#8220;I have answered for you;
and you cannot return to your associates here without
falsifying my pledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes clouded in embarrassment. &#8220;What can
I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place you are going to put absolute
confidence in your new gaoler and let him look after
your future, as soon as he knows what you wish to
do. He is a very stern gaoler and will take no refusals,&#8221;
I added, interrupting a threatened protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are anything like as famished as I am, your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
first desire will be to eat something;&#8221; and we turned
into the first hotel we reached.</p>

<p>Some objection was taken to our appearance&mdash;we
were like three towsled tramps&mdash;but money soon
overcame that, and while I was doing what I could
to get rid of the results of the night&#8217;s imprisonment&mdash;Pia
having gone off with a servant for a similar
purpose&mdash;I listened to Bryant&#8217;s account of his experience.</p>

<p>It was pretty much what I anticipated, but with
an unexpected result. He had waited for me outside
Inez&#8217; house for some hours and had then contrived
to send a message to Captain Bolton. Together they
had agreed that the skipper should go and tell the
police about my disappearance, while Bryant remained
on watch.</p>

<p>But in some way the abduction plot had become
known. The police had jumbled the two things up
and, on reaching Inez&#8217; house, their first act was to
arrest Bryant himself on suspicion, refusing to believe
or even listen to his explanation; and he had been in
prison up to the moment of his being brought in to
identify me.</p>

<p>It turned out that Captain Bolton had been making
inquiries everywhere both for me and for Bryant;
and Volheno had heard of the latter&#8217;s imprisonment
and had been on the point of ordering his release
when General Sama had communicated with him
about me.</p>

<p>I told Bryant to hurry his breakfast and go down
to the quay to send word to the skipper that we were
both at liberty, and then drive to Miralda&#8217;s house
for news of her, and bring me the result of his inquiry
to my rooms.</p>

<p>Pia&#8217;s story was soon told. She had no living relatives.
She and her only brother had lived together
until he had been led to join the revolutionary party.
His arrest had soon followed through the betrayal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
of a false friend who had tried to make love to her
and in revenge for his defeat had betrayed him. The
brother, feeble and delicate in health, had been
questioned as to the plans and names of his companions,
and Pia declared that his refusal to speak
had been punished with the lash. He had died in
prison, and this had driven her into hot rebellion
against those whom she termed his murderers.</p>

<p>She had been hunted for by the police; but her
arrest on the previous night had been an accident&mdash;she
was caught as I had once been&mdash;in the thick of a
fracas between the police and the people. She had
not given her right name, but, feeling sure she would
be identified, she looked forward to sharing the same
fate as her brother.</p>

<p>This fact explained the readiness of the Governor
to liberate her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no friends anywhere?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only one friend in the world; but when
my brother was arrested, he had to fly for his life.
That was almost on the eve of the day we were to
have been married,&#8221; she said simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it then. You will go out to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tossed up her hands. &#8220;Some day, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no &#8216;perhaps&#8217; about it and no &#8216;some
day.&#8217; Do you know that if it had not been for you
I should have had that lash this morning. If you
had not mentioned the Governor&#8217;s name, I should not
have known him and been able to do what I did.
You will go out to New York by the first boat you can
catch, and you will leave Lisbon for Paris to-day,
and go to an address I will give you to wait in safety
until that boat starts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Monsieur!&#8221; she cried tremulously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your gaoler, remember, and responsible for
you. You must let me persuade you to do what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
say. And now, I must go. Hurry your preparations
and return to me here;&#8221; and I gave her the address
of my flat.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I cannot accept your money, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can use it. I shall lend it to you, and when
you are married in the new world, you will soon be
able to repay me. There is a place for such a woman
as you in the world and good work waiting to be
done by you. You promise to come to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could not speak. The tears, which no persecution,
nor the horrors of the past night, nor even
the almost certain prospect of the lash itself had been
able to draw from her, were standing thick in her
eyes as I left her and hurried to my rooms.</p>

<p>I decided to go to Volheno as soon as I had changed
into some decent clothes, and secure a pardon for
Miralda in return for a full statement of what I knew,
and then obtain his assistance in searching for her.
There was a faint chance that Bryant would bring
back some news of her from the vicontesse; but
he did not arrive before I was ready to go to Volheno.</p>

<p>I found him studying the paper which General de
Sama had sent to him from the prison, and his first
question was about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why have you made prisoners of some of His
Majesty&#8217;s officers?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have much to tell you and of very grave importance,
but there is a condition,&#8221; I replied. I
told him enough to convince him that my information
was such as to place clues in his hand strong enough
to enable him to break up the whole revolutionary
movement so far as the Pretender&#8217;s friends were concerned;
and then named my condition.</p>

<p>Without mentioning their names I described at
length the means which had been adopted to force
Miralda, Vasco and Dagara into the scheme and how
they had helped me to thwart it, and asked for a
written assurance of pardon for them all.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>He fought hard and tried every means to get the
names from me. A long and at times very heated
altercation followed, in which I declared that I would
make all the trouble I could on the score of my own
treatment, and finally that I would seek an audience
of the king himself and lay all the facts before him.</p>

<p>I won the victory in the end, and I had the assurance
in my pocket when I gave him the story, confining
my statement to what I had overheard on the
<i>Rampallo</i> and all that had followed from it. We
then arranged for the <i>Stella</i> to go out at once to pick
up the <i>Rampallo</i> and to carry out Government agents
to take over charge of her and the officers.</p>

<p>I purposely abstained from mentioning Inez, but
the fact that I had been arrested in her house led
Volheno to question me about her. I found that the
house had been raided through a blunder of the
police who had mixed up some information they had
received with Captain Bolton&#8217;s statement that I was
a prisoner there. Volheno had nothing definite
against her, and I would not give him any information.</p>

<p>Of Miralda&#8217;s whereabouts he knew no more than
I. She had not been arrested, however; and I returned
to my rooms to learn the result of Bryant&#8217;s
visit to her house.</p>

<p>He brought no news of her. He had seen the viscontesse
who was almost prostrate with grief and
anxiety at her absence.</p>

<p>There was only one inference to draw. Miralda
must still be with Barosa; and where to look for them
baffled me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV<br />


<small>ON THE TRACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;RACKED my wits in vain to think of some clue
to the place where Barosa was likely to hide.
I ransacked my memory to recall every incident of
my stay in the city, every word which had been
dropped in my hearing, and every man I had met,
having any connexion with him or any of his companions.
But it led to no result.</p>

<p>All I could think of was to institute a house-to-house
search of the whole city; and I wrote to urge
Volheno to have this done, declaring I would cheerfully
bear all the expense and give a liberal reward
to any one who brought me the information I craved.</p>

<p>But the thought of the length of time which such
a search would involve drove me to the verge of
despair. I must find some means by which I myself
could take part in the search. To sit still with folded
hands was a sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>I thought of Inez. She might now be willing to
help me. I had the key now to what had so perplexed
me during the last few minutes I had spent
in her house. While she and Barosa were wrangling,
Marco had rushed up with the news of the police
raid, and this had prevented Inez from keeping her
promise to return to me.</p>

<p>She had meant to return&mdash;that was clear now&mdash;and
she was in fierce earnest that Miralda should leave
the house with me. The loaded revolver&mdash;which
had proved such a Greek gift when the police had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
found it upon me&mdash;had been honestly given, to provide
me with the means of overcoming any opposition,
whether from Barosa or others, to our getting
away.</p>

<p>But the words she had used in giving it only pointed
to greater danger now. &#8220;Get Miralda away or I will
not answer for myself.&#8221; With Barosa and Miralda
still associated, the devil of jealousy I had roused
in Inez might goad her to some act of wild rage against
Miralda; and the thought that I had placed her in
this added peril stung and scorched me with all the
agony of a festering wound.</p>

<p>My helplessness was torture; and yet I could not think
how to commence my search, where to go, or what
to do. Stay in the house I could not, and I rushed
out into the streets, wandering aimlessly about,
scrutinizing every one I met, as if I expected that
some of those I sought would stroll about publicly
in the full light of day in order that I might see them.</p>

<p>After a time I found myself close to Inez&#8217; house,
and as I loitered about I narrowly escaped being
once more arrested by the police. I went from there
to the house in the Rua Catania and then to the Rua
Formosa, where I had been subjected to the &#8220;test&#8221;&mdash;the
most unlikely spots in all the city, of course,
where I should find any one. And that I should go
there at all only proved the fatuous vagueness of
my thoughts.</p>

<p>From the latter place I was on my way back to my
rooms when I remembered where Henriques had been
employed as a porter. I hurried there at once, but
without result. Not a trace was to be found.</p>

<p>I returned to my rooms in despair. It was now late
in the afternoon, and little Pia was waiting for me.
She had finished her few preparations and was ready
to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in great trouble, Mr. Donnington. What
is the matter?&#8221; she asked as I entered, her smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
of welcome changing on the instant to a look of deep
concern and sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am in sore trouble. Wellnigh beside
myself, but I will see to your matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me. Let me help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you help me, I wonder.&#8221; I had not thought
of her. She might know of some places where I could
search, but on the other hand, she could not give
me the information without bringing those with
whom she had been associated into danger of arrest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me. You can surely trust me,&#8221; she urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could only help me by betraying your former
friends. Do you know a Dr. Barosa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By name, yes. There is nothing you can ask me
I will not tell you. You believe that as I am sure
you believe I will keep everything you say secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few seconds decided me to tell her enough to
make the position clear&mdash;that what I wanted was to
know where to look for Barosa.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know that I could help you much in
any case. It is very difficult,&#8221; she murmured, her
face troubled and her manner expressing both perplexity
and wistful anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said I might have to betray my former associates.
Does that mean that you will take the police
with you?&#8221; She paused and sat biting her lip in
great distress. &#8220;If you ask me, I cannot refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can find Mademoiselle Dominguez without
the police it is all I want.&#8221;</p>

<p>She brightened instantly. &#8220;Can you get me some
disguise?&#8221; Seeing my surprise, she explained,
&#8220;I would go without it, but it would not help you.
Since we parted this morning, I have had a very narrow
escape from arrest in my own name. The police
are swarming near my lodging, and it is in that district
we must search. I was on my way there when
by good fortune I met a friend&mdash;a girl who had lived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
in the same house as myself. She warned me not
to go near it because the police were in it. Her
brother had been arrested and she herself was flying.
To go as I am, therefore, would not help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not go at all. Tell me where to go,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>She hesitated again. &#8220;If I hesitate, you will
understand me. Let me be frank. Some of the
people have been very kind to me and to put them
into the hands of the police would be an ill return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not take the police with me. Tell me where
to search, and I&#8217;ll find means of doing what I need
without the police.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little to the west of the Theatre of Donna
Amelia and close to the Square of Camoes is a nest
of streets; and many of the houses are those of our
friends where any refugees are certain of a ready shelter.
It is there I should expect to find those whom
you seek. But you must go not as you are. It
would be not only useless but dangerous, and you must
be careful to have help at hand. If your object were
suspected, you would look in vain for a friend in all
that district.&#8221;</p>

<p>I opened a map and she pointed the neighbourhood
out to me and indicated a spot at the corner of the
Square which would be the best for my purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three theatres close there, and the
hawkers always stand about there to catch the people
going to them. You could thus watch without being
suspected;&#8221; she explained.</p>

<p>I took her advice and set about my preparations
forthwith, and while getting ready, a thought occurred
to me. I sent Bryant with a note to Volheno
telling him I had an important clue and I asked
him, as I had already had a narrow escape of being
arrested, to give me a line or two which would protect
me from anything of the kind and enable me to call
upon the police to assist me if I should need their help.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>Pia helped me to disguise myself as a pedlar of
matches, suggesting many clever touches&mdash;the result
probably of her experiences&mdash;and when I was ready
not a soul in all Lisbon would have recognized me.</p>

<p>Volheno sent me the letter I asked for, and when
Bryant returned with it I told him to disguise himself
also and to watch me from another corner of the
Square, and to have Simmons and Foster, who had not
gone in the <i>Stella</i>, in a liquor shop close at hand.</p>

<p>Then I slipped out of the house and shuffled off
on my search in the character of a match seller. I had
about a mile to go across the city to my destination,
but I did not reach it. I had just turned into the
Rua da Carmo when a man carrying a bag and having
the air of a commercial traveller crossed the street
and came up to buy a box of matches.</p>

<p>His disguise was good, but as he lit his cigarette
I recognized him. It was Marco; and in a moment
my other plan was abandoned and I decided to follow
him.</p>

<p>He made straight for the Central Station. After
studying the time-tables, he went to the booking place,
entered into conversation with the clerk and bought
some tickets, turned away with a casual air and left
the building again.</p>

<p>Either Pia was all wrong in her guess as to the
locality where Barosa was likely to hide, or Marco
was not going back to him. He sauntered idly across
the Square of San Pedro, turned into the Rua Bitesgo,
quickened his pace slightly as he reached the Rua da
Magdalena, and branching off to the left, when about
half-way down, threaded his way at a quick pace
among the maze of streets which form the district of
Eastern Lisbon.</p>

<p>This was directly in the opposite direction from that
which Pia had suggested; but I was certain by the
change from his former sauntering pace to a quick
stride, that he was taking me where I wanted to go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>His speed made it difficult for me to keep him in sight
without his discovering that I was shadowing him.
Twice I nearly lost him as he made a double turn in
the short tortuous streets, and after that I had to
lessen the distance between us, doing my best to
slink along in the shadow of the houses.</p>

<p>Presently he turned into a very steep hilly street
and, slackening, began to look about him warily. I
guessed that he was getting near his destination, and
redoubled my caution. About half-way down the
hill he stopped at the corner of a dark street somewhat
wider than the rest, where the houses were larger,
and I slipped to cover in the wide porch of a house
on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Two men were in sight, one coming down the hill
and the other up, and lighting a cigarette as a pretext
for loitering, Marco waited until both men had passed
and gave each of them a sharp searching look. As
soon as they were out of sight, he turned and hurried
along the side street.</p>

<p>I followed quickly, but when I reached the corner
he had disappeared.</p>

<p>I had run him to earth; but which house he had
entered I could not tell, of course. I passed the
mouth of the street and had a good look at the
houses. He had not had time to go more than fifty
yards; and within that distance there were only six
houses, the two nearest of which were detached and
stood well apart from one another.</p>

<p>Keeping under the shadow of the buildings I walked
the length of the street and discovered that it had no
outlet at the farther end. I returned to the corner with
the same caution, and then considered what to do.</p>

<p>I felt at liberty to seek the help of the police if
necessary. My promise to Pia not to do so did not
apply now, since my discovery was not due to anything
she had told me, but to the accidental meeting
with Marco.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>At the same time, I did not wish to bring the police
into it except in the very last extremity. It was
quite possible that they would arrest every one in the
house, including Miralda herself; and after my
terrible experiences of the previous night, the thought
that she should endure even for an hour the horrors
of such a den of beastliness was unendurable.</p>

<p>If it proved necessary for me to enter any house
in search of Miralda, it would be nothing short of sheer
madness to do so alone; and in that case I must
have the help of the police.</p>

<p>But it might not come to that. Marco&#8217;s visit to
the railway station and his purchase of tickets was
plain evidence that some one, presumably Barosa,
was meditating immediate flight from the city. But
as there was only the one outlet from the street,
he could not leave without passing me; and certainly
he could not get Miralda away.</p>

<p>There was another consideration. The meditated
flight suggested that Miralda was not in any immediate
danger. It might be better to risk a little delay,
therefore, rather than take a hasty step with consequences
which I might afterwards have bitter cause
to regret.</p>

<p>Then I began to consider whether I could possibly
find means of sending a message to Bryant so as to
bring him and the others to my assistance. With
them to help me, I should have no hesitation in entering
the house, if I could ascertain definitely in which
Barosa was hiding.</p>

<p>I was puzzling over this when Marco came out of
the second house, and I noticed one little significant
fact. In addition to the bag, he was carrying an
overcoat on his arm. This meant that he at any rate
had been staying in the house; and it decided me not
to follow him.</p>

<p>He walked to the corner of the street and was
turning up the hill away from me when he changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
his mind and came straight towards me. I drew
back against the wall to avoid him, and he had all but
passed when he caught sight of me. The start he gave
showed that he recognized me as the man from whom
he had bought the matches.</p>

<p>He paused a moment, put his hand to his head, as
if he had forgotten something and turned to retrace
his steps. He meant to warn the others in the house,
of course; and as I had to prevent this at any cost,
I stepped forward quickly and grabbed him by the
wrist.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with me, you old fool?&#8221;
he said roughly, trying at the same time to shake off
my hold.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my prisoner,&#8221; I said sternly. &#8220;Who are
in that house there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean. Which house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one you have just left. I know you. Answer at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>His answer was both clever-witted and quick.
He flung the overcoat he carried over my head and
made a fierce snatch to break away from me, while
reaching at the same time for a weapon.</p>

<p>I held on, however, and managed to trip him up. As
we fell together the coat dropped away and I was in
time to seize the barrel of a revolver he had succeeded
in drawing, and drag it out of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Marco,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>He knew me then. &#8220;The Englishman!&#8221; he cried
with an oath of unbounded amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the Englishman,&#8221; I said.</p>

<small>THE PROBLEM OF AN EMPTY HOUSE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE discovery of my identity, combined no
doubt with the fact that I had disarmed Marco,
put an end to any thought of resistance, so I pulled
him up and forced him against the wall, and kicked
his bag and coat close to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Marco, tell me who is in that house and be
quick about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me go if I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hand you to the police if you don&#8217;t. You
went to the railway station to-night and took some
tickets. I saw you and then followed you here. You
went into the second house across the road. Now
who are in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barosa, Maral, Countess Inglesia and Mademoiselle
Dominguez,&#8221; he said sullenly after a slight pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you come out for now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I tell you everything, will you let me go?&#8221;</p>

<p>I repeated my question.</p>

<p>&#8220;To fetch a carriage. Mademoiselle Dominguez
is in no danger,&#8221; he added, thinking probably to
appease me. &#8220;She is going to leave with us, and her
mother is to join us at the station. I took a letter to
her this evening. If I tell you everything, will you
let me go?&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I wished to get rid of him now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
that I had obtained the information I needed. But
I did not let him know it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I answered fiercely with an oath. &#8220;You
tried to murder me yesterday, you villain, and you
shall pay for it with your life. I have the police in
hiding close here and I&#8217;ll give you to them!&#8221; Then
I made a pretence of hauling him away, but at the
time I stooped as if to pick up his bag and loosened
my hold of him.</p>

<p>He saw his chance and took it. He tore himself
free, pushed me violently away, snatched up his bag and
coat and darted off. With a cry of rage, I started
in pursuit, but I went no more than a few yards,
just far enough to convince him I was in earnest,
and then returned to my corner well satisfied to have
got rid of him so easily.</p>

<p>His information put a different complexion on
matters. As he was going for the carriage which
was to take Barosa and the rest to the station, the
time for their departure must be drawing near; and
when he did not return, some one would probably
come out to look for him, or they would all have to
start for the station on foot.</p>

<p>I could well afford to wait for either result. Miralda
was safe thus far, and, according to Marco, was willing
to trust to Inez and Barosa to get her away from the
city. The two latter had probably patched up a peace,
and it was no doubt Inez&#8217; plan to have the viscontesse
with them&mdash;as a useful check on Barosa.</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour later the door of the
house opened and some one looked out. I could not distinguish
whether it was a man or a woman, however,
as my attention had been distracted by three or four
men at some distance away who were coming down
the hill in my direction.</p>

<p>I made out soon afterwards that they were police,
and as I did not wish to be seen and questioned at
that moment, I slipped along the by-street and hid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
in a doorway nearly opposite the house I was watching,
to hide there until they had passed.</p>

<p>Before they reached the turning, however, some
one in the disguise of an old man came out of the house
and shambled along toward the corner. It must
be either Barosa or Maral, I knew; and as it
would vastly simplify things if I could scare him
away as I had scared Marco, I slipped like a shadow
across the road and got between him and the house.</p>

<p>He heard me and turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I arrest you, Dr. Barosa,&#8221; I cried, and started as if
to run after him.</p>

<p>Taking me for a police agent, he paused a second,
drew out his revolver, and then, thinking probably
he could both save himself by flight and prevent the
others in the house being discovered, he turned round
and bolted.</p>

<p>But in avoiding me, he ran right into the arms of
the police who reached the corner of the street at the
same minute. There was a short sharp scuffle, a cry
or two of astonishment, a gruff call to surrender,
a pause, and then a shot.</p>

<p>One of the police fell, and I saw Barosa break away,
reach the middle of the road, and raise his hand to his
head. A flash and a report followed, he lurched
heavily and then dropped, as a drunken man drops,
nervelessly and all in a heap.</p>

<p>Everything had occurred with such dramatic swiftness
that I could scarcely realize it. In a few seconds
a number of people came hurrying up, attracted by
the noise of the shots, and as they crowded round
the police, I joined them and edged through to the
front.</p>

<p>The man whom Barosa had shot was sitting on the
doorstep of the house at the corner, hatless and
very white, but I heard one of his comrades say
that he was not seriously hurt.</p>

<p>Two others had carried Barosa close to the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
spot and were bending down, examining his wound
and feeling his heart for the pulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead,&#8221; announced one of them with an oath, and
as he rose I saw Barosa&#8217;s face. The false beard
and wig he had been wearing had fallen off in the
scuffle; and the right cheek and temple were
discoloured with the powder, the blue-black
mark showing plainly in contrast to the grey pallor of
the face.</p>

<p>He had chosen death rather than imprisonment;
and after my experiences of one night in that hell,
I was not surprised.</p>

<p>The police did not recognize him and had no idea
that he was a man of any importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does any one know him?&#8221; was asked, and some
half-dozen of those present pressed forward, looked
at him, and shook their heads.</p>

<p>I took advantage of the movement to back away,
and as I turned I came face to face with Maral. He
had not seen Barosa, and I did not mean that he
should. Very much to his surprise, I linked my arm
in his and drew him away across the mouth of
the street to the corner from which I had kept my
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come with me or you are lost,&#8221; I said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Sebastian Maral. The police are there.
You must fly or you will be taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend if you go, an enemy if you stay. My
name does not matter. A secret agent&mdash;but you
once did me a good turn. I am going to raid the
second house over there. I give you a chance to fly;
if you stay I must hand you to my comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>I cut him short. &#8220;Say which it shall be. Quick.
I can&#8217;t give you another moment or I shall be seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
with you. Are there any men left in that house?
We have taken Barosa.&#8221;</p>

<p>An oath burst from him and he began to tremble.
&#8220;There are only two women there. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant there was a movement among the
little throng across the street. Two or three of the
people went running past us and I saw others hurrying
in the opposite direction. They were sent by the
police probably in search of a conveyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;My men are coming. Which is it to be. Quick,&#8221; I
said, and let go my hold of him. He hesitated for
no more than a second and then, tossing his hands
up in despair, he turned away, walked a few steps,
then quickened his pace, and at last ran at full speed.</p>

<p>Barosa having been caught as he was leaving the
little side street, it was possible that the police might
take a fancy to search some of the houses, so I deemed
it prudent to hang about until they had gone and the
commotion caused by the affair had subsided.</p>

<p>Two carriages arrived almost together, one from
each direction. Barosa and the wounded man were
placed in one and the police drove away. The driver
of the other was moving off, grumbling at having been
brought there for nothing, when I stepped into the
roadway and hailed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drive away and come back in a quarter of an hour,
and wait at this corner for me,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t your highness like a four-in-hand?&#8221;
he asked with a contemptuous jeer at my poverty-stricken
appearance.</p>

<p>A milreis changed his sneer to a glance of curiosity
and amazement. &#8220;It will pay you to do what I say
and keep your tongue between your teeth,&#8221; I said
curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he replied, and rattled away down the
hill.</p>

<p>I crossed to the house at once and knocked lightly
at the door. No one opened it; so I knocked again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
a little louder; and again a third time. Still with
no result. The house was, as I have said, all in darkness,
and, although I listened intently, I could not hear a
sound.</p>

<p>It was probable that either the three men had had
keys or that the door was to be opened only in response
to some agreed knock. I did not know it, of course,
and might stay there rapping all night without being
admitted.</p>

<p>Both Inez and Miralda would be intensely alarmed
by the failure of the three men to return and if they
had heard Barosa&#8217;s shot or had seen anything of the
commotion that followed, they would certainly conclude
that the three had been arrested and mistake
my summons for that of the police bent upon effecting
an arrest.</p>

<p>It was a most provoking and unexpected check.
I left the door and fumbled my way round to the back
to try and get admittance there. I was no expert at
burgling, but even if I had been I should have been
puzzled how to get into this house. There was a door at
the back letting out upon a small garden; but it was
securely fastened, and every window in the lower part of
the house was protected by both outside bars and inside
shutters. It was hopeless to try and force them.</p>

<p>There was a stack pipe running up to the gutter
at the roof; but it was so placed that if I climbed it
I could not reach any window except one on the top
floor; and an attempt to enter that way meant a very
considerable risk that I should break my neck. There
was no urgent necessity to run such a risk, so I went
round again to the front of the house to look for a
chance of getting in there.</p>

<p>It was no more promising than the back, so far as
the windows within reach were concerned.</p>

<p>It was almost ludicrous to find myself in such a
fix. Here was I able and eager to save both Inez
and Miralda; and there were they shivering with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
panic and regarding me as an enemy bent on their
destruction and arrest; and only this infernal locked
door and the barred windows between us.</p>

<p>I tried knocking again, but with no better result than
before, and then it occurred to me that although I
had examined the front and the back and one side, I had
not inspected the fourth side.</p>

<p>The chances of breaking in there were better. There
was a small projection built about half-way up the
house with a window level with the first floor, which
did not appear to have either shutters or bars. A
stack pipe offered a chance of reaching this window,
and although the pipe was unpleasantly insecure I
judged that even if it gave way I could not hurt
myself much, as there was a flower bed with some
shrubs on the spot where I should fall.</p>

<p>I began the ascent very cautiously, digging my toes
into the courses of the bricks where I could, and carefully
testing the bearing strain of the pipe before
trusting my full weight on it. It was a very difficult
business, for part of my disguise consisted of a long
overcoat which hampered almost every step I took.</p>

<p>But I made the ascent safely and managed to get a
grip of the window ledge, and then, pulling myself up
till my chin was level with the window, I found a
slender but sufficient hold for my feet on a ledge of the
brickwork.</p>

<p>To my relief the window was unfastened. I opened
it very cautiously, climbed in over the sill, into a tiny
room quite bare of furniture. I listened intently and,
not hearing a sound, tried the handle of the door.
To my intense chagrin, it was locked. It seemed
as if some diabolical ingenuity was at work to prevent
my effecting Miralda&#8217;s rescue.</p>

<p>The door opened outwards and that made it easier for
me to force it; but I was loth to make the row which
this would cause and so advertise the fact that I was in
the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>It had to be done, however, so I put my shoulder
to it and tried first to force it open with quiet pressure.
This proving unavailing I dashed myself against it
with all my weight and strength. At the third attempt
it yielded with a crash which echoed through the house,
making a din which would have roused the heaviest
sleeper in the remotest part of the building.</p>

<p>Then I stood listening again intently. Not a sound.
I was close to the head of the stairs. Fearing that the
noise I had made would scarce Inez and Miralda half
out of their senses, I tried to reassure them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miralda, Miralda. It is I, Ralph,&#8221; I called loudly,
but only the echo of my own voice replied.</p>

<p>Disconcerted at this, I lit a match and hurried through
the rooms, calling her name as I went. I searched
first those on the floor where I was; next those above,
and then went below.</p>

<p>Save for the scanty furniture, the house was empty,
and there was not a sign that Miralda had ever been
in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI<br />


<small>UNTIL LIFE&#8217;S END</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EARLIER in the evening, barely an hour before,
indeed, the discovery that the house was
deserted would have alarmed me profoundly, for
Miralda&#8217;s disappearance might then have had a very
sinister significance. But she was no longer in any
danger. Barosa was dead and I had the assurance
of the pardon for her association with his plot.</p>

<p>Instead of being alarmed therefore, I burst out
laughing as the reason for her disappearance flashed
upon me.</p>

<p>She had obviously run away from me.</p>

<p>When first Marco, then Barosa and lastly Maral
had left the house not to return, Miralda and Inez
would have been both desperately perplexed and
thoroughly scared. Waiting to fly in accordance
with the plan which Marco had explained to me, they
would immediately conclude either that the men had
been arrested or had had to run from the police.</p>

<p>In this condition of fear they would naturally keep
a sharp look-out, and thus would have seen me.
In my disguise their inevitable inference would be
that I was a police spy who had discovered their
hiding-place, and my movements had been just such
as would tend to confirm that belief.</p>

<p>When I broke into the house, therefore, they would
realize that their only chance was to fly from it,
especially when they found that I was alone and that
no police were in the street to stop them.</p>

<p>A moment&#8217;s consideration prompted the conclusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
that they would make for the railway station in the
hope that Barosa or one of the other men would elude
arrest and be there to meet them.</p>

<p>I hurried out of the house, therefore. The carriage
was waiting, and having questioned the driver and
found that he had not seen any one come out of the side
street, I told him to drive to the station as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>It was fairly certain that neither Maral nor Marco
would run the risk of going to the railway. Barosa
probably had the tickets in his possession; and as I
was resolved that Inez should leave the city, my first
act was to purchase a ticket and put it in an envelope
together with some banknotes, in case she should be
without money.</p>

<p>Then I made a round of the building in search of
them. They would almost certainly be disguised,
but I was confident that my instinct would enable me to
detect Miralda, however well disguised, while the
fact that the viscontesse was to be of the party would
help me.</p>

<p>Neither the viscontesse nor any one even remotely
suggesting Miralda was in the station, however. A
train was due out in a quarter of an hour after my
arrival, and I loitered near the barrier, keeping a
sharp but futile look-out, until it occurred to me that
I myself might be defeating my object. If the two
had seen me as a spy getting into the house, they
would instantly conclude that I was watching for
them now. So I looked for a place where I could
hide and still watch.</p>

<p>Five more minutes passed and I scrutinized every
passenger and every individual within sight. A
rather lanky youth in the company of a squat, stout,
broad-shouldered market woman, apparently his
mother, appeared to be waiting to meet some one,
but there was not another soul loitering anywhere in
the station.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>As the time was now getting very short, I left my
hiding-place to go and look outside; and as I neared
this couple, the boy put his arm through his mother&#8217;s,
drew her attention to something at the other side of the
station, and walked away with her. The woman was
lame and rolled in her walk with a most grotesque
waddle.</p>

<p>After a dozen yards or so they paused and the young
fellow looked round. He appeared disconcerted to
see that I was watching them, and drew his mother
forward again.</p>

<p>Then I nearly laughed aloud. The woman took two
or three steps without either the waddle or the limp;
suddenly recollected herself and went lame with the
wrong foot.</p>

<p>I hastened after them and as they quickened their
pace, I called out in English: &#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten
which is your lame foot, Miralda.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stopped and turned, but even when I was
close to them and saw their faces clearly, I should
not have recognized the market woman as Miralda,
nor the lanky youth as Inez, had it not been for
Miralda&#8217;s eyes. I had looked too often into them not
to know them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, Ralph; you&#8217;ve been running away from
me the last hour or more,&#8221; I added, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph!&#8221; cried Miralda. &#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know all directly, but I must speak to
your son there first. He has not a moment to lose if
he means to catch this train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Donnington?&#8221; exclaimed Inez. &#8220;Where&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must let me talk, please,&#8221; I interrupted.
&#8220;When Dr. Barosa left that house he ran into a party
of police, but I managed to get a word or two with him
before he fled, and I have to give you this ticket and
the money with it. You are to leave by this train.
If you remain another hour in Lisbon, you will be
arrested.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t a second to spare,&#8221; I cried, giving
her the ticket and pressing the envelope into her
hand. &#8220;You will learn everything later. Miralda
is pardoned. And now go, or it will be too late;&#8221;
and I urged her away in the direction of the barrier,
without giving her time to question me.</p>

<p>She hesitated, walked away a few steps, paused
in doubt, and was turning back, when the call to the
passengers to enter the train came. She choked
back a hundred unspoken questions, hurried through the
barrier and got into the train.</p>

<p>With a sigh of satisfaction I watched it move along
the platform and disappear in the darkness, and then
turned to Miralda. Her disguise was really wonderful.
The complexion was darkened almost to the tan of a
mulatto, and the skin of the forehead, nose and upper
half of the cheeks was lined very cunningly and had
the wrinkled look of age: on the left side of the face
was what looked like the cicatrice of a bad wound or
burn, and on the right a large disfiguring claret-coloured
birth-mark. Both mark and scar extended to the
lips, and along the edges of both and across the lower lip
was fastened a cleverly moulded skin-covered plastic
pad which gave the appearance of the flabby cheeks
and fat double chin of a woman of middle age, the
lower part being lost in the folds of a neckerchief.</p>

<p>The effect was grotesque, and as I stared at her in
amazement, the upper part of her face crinkled, while
the lower remained stolidly impassive. &#8220;Are you
trying to smile?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look comical enough to make any one smile,&#8221;
she replied, her lips scarcely moving, as she spoke
through her nearly-closed teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I do. But have you seen yourself in a
glass? Whoever did that, knew his business; but
you&mdash;you are not exactly pretty, you know. I can
scarcely believe it is really you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>&#8220;You are not even clean,&#8221; she retorted, tossing
her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a hideous birth-mark and a double chin,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re a Jew with a hook nose and your grey
beard is as dirty as it is long.&#8221;</p>

<p>We must have made an odd-looking couple in all
truth&mdash;a fat, waddling, disfigured, old market woman
and a dirty down-at-heels Jew pedlar, and I saw
the station people were beginning to eye us suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s time the market woman went home,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is waiting for her mother, Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;ll be found at home. Barosa didn&#8217;t
mean her to leave to-night or she would have been here.
Nothing matters now except to get you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Dr. Barosa?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; This was true in the letter; I
had never been down where he deserved to be. &#8220;When
I saw him last he was in the hands of the police,&#8221; I
added.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I may be arrested also at any minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by the police. You are pardoned, but the
other arrest is imminent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This, by the old Jew,&#8221; I replied, linking my arm
in hers to leave the station. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how fast the
market woman can waddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was a willing prisoner and pressed close to me
with a happy unrestrained laugh, and then clapped
her hand to her face with an exclamation of dismay and
let her head droop as we went out into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you cry out?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s coming off. What shall I do?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have made me laugh. I didn&#8217;t
expect to have to laugh when this was put on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven, we can laugh as much as we like
now&mdash;even at one another. Can&#8217;t you get it all off?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
The Jew&#8217;s going,&#8221; I said, and I took off my grey beard,
eyebrows, nose and wig, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got all but the last bit off,&#8221; said Miralda, as
she held up her face under the light of a lamp and
laughed merrily.</p>

<p>Cicatrice, birth-mark and double chin were in one
piece and adhering now by the mark. I peeled this
back carefully, and then held her upturned face close
to mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought the Jew who arrested me was gone,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the market woman he arrested. Miralda
is free&mdash;if she wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem much like it;&#8221; and she moved
in my arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she wish it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t wish to go to prison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she wish to be free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it would be safe for her to be free
in the streets alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she willing to pay for an escort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends on the terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several. The first is that you smile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do that although my face is still very sticky;&#8221;
and she smiled and grimaced.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next is to say one word and promise to answer
a simple question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must promise first. But the answer must
be the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what an insult! That&#8217;s the Jew back again.
Anything more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the proper corollary to the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the escort is rather a coward to
make all these terms now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but he insists all the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph,&#8221; I said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy&mdash;Ralph,&#8221; she said with purposeful
unconcern. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done two of the things&mdash;the escort
ought to take me half-way home for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the question.&#8221; I paused and her light
assumption of indifference changed under my earnest
gaze. She made an effort to release herself. But
I held her fast. &#8220;Do you love&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ralph!&#8221; A very different tone this as she hid
her face against my shoulder and then let me lift it
that our lips might meet in the rapturous ecstasy of
the lingering betrothal kiss.</p>

<p>Roused by the sound of approaching wheels, we drew
apart and walked on hand in hand.</p>

<p>It proved to be the carriage which had taken me
to the station and the driver asked if I needed him.</p>

<p>Oblivious to all else save our happiness, I should
have let him pass, but the question brought me to
earth, and I stopped him. He stared in some astonishment
at us both as I put Miralda into the carriage
and told him to drive first to my rooms.</p>

<p>I remembered that Pia was waiting there, and
when I told Miralda about her, she declared she would
take her home.</p>

<p>When we reached my rooms, Simmons was there,
Bryant having sent him back when he did not see me,
and I told him to go in search of Bryant. Then I
took Pia out to Miralda and drove home with her.</p>

<p>We found that the viscontesse had not heard anything
of the projected flight from the city. The letter which
Miralda had written to tell her about it had not been
delivered, Barosa having substituted for it one written
by himself to say Miralda would be home that evening.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see I didn&#8217;t answer that question after all,&#8221;
said Miralda as we were alone and I was bidding her
good-night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which question?&#8221; I asked, as if I did not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you? I had an impression&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in words,&#8221; she broke in with a flash of happy
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a challenge. You shall answer it now,&#8221;
I cried, putting my arm as far round her much-swathed
waist as it would reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are developing a very masterful manner, Mr.
Jew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary with a rebellious market woman.
Answer it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which question?&#8221; she mocked, mimicking my
indifferent tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;you&mdash;love&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She put her hand to my lips, and silenced me, and
then lifting her eyes to mine she threw her arms round
my neck and whispered: &#8220;With all my heart, Ralph,
and for all my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>And again we sealed the compact with the all
appropriate formalities.</p>

<p>The next morning M. Volheno sent for me and I
was glad to find him anxious to hush up the whole
matter of the Abduction Plot. In pursuance of this
policy, two conditions were attached to Miralda&#8217;s
pardon&mdash;absolute silence about everything and a
year&#8217;s expatriation for her, her mother and the visconte.
Vasco was to be transferred to a regiment in Portuguese
Africa.</p>

<p>I told him of Barosa&#8217;s death, and that he was really
Luis Beriardos, Dom Miguel&#8217;s trusted agent, and he
was genuinely relieved. Barosa&#8217;s fate was never
publicly known and he was buried under a different
name as the result of a concocted identification.</p>

<p>The fate of his associates on the <i>Rampallo</i> I never
learned. The yacht and the prisoners on her were
handed over to the men whom Volheno sent out in
the <i>Stella</i> with secret instructions; and when they
returned neither the skipper nor Burroughs knew
anything.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>By the time of the <i>Stella&#8217;s</i> arrival, the viscontesse
had completed all arrangements for the year&#8217;s enforced
absence; and a few hours after the yacht&#8217;s anchor
was dropped it was weighed again and I was taking a
farewell look at the city.</p>

<p>Miralda and her mother were below and Pia was
with them. She was to sail for America from Southampton.</p>

<p>I was heartily glad to go. It had been a strenuous
love quest, but all the trouble and the dangers were
forgotten in that joyous hour of success, in the glowing
consciousness that I had won the woman I loved, and
the thrilling realization of my hopes.</p>

<p>As I stood dreaming of the happiness to come,
there was the soft rustle of a skirt and a hand was
slipped into my arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are glad to go, Ralph?&#8221; asked Miralda.
&#8220;You were smiling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of my fellow passenger,&#8221; I whispered.
&#8220;And she is smiling, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her eyes were very thoughtful behind the smile.
It was natural. All her young life had been passed
in the city she was leaving.</p>

<p>She turned her eyes from me, let them roam over
the glorious panorama of the city and the hills beyond,
and then turned to me again. &#8220;I was trying to think
if I have any regrets. I have not. I have not in all
my heart a thought that is not wholly happy at being
with you. But it has been my home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I said, understanding; and I took her
hand and pressed my lips to it. &#8220;You will grow to
love the new home, and it shall be one of peace and
content and, so far as I can ensure it, of happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; she asked, with half mischievous,
half wistful glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What more would you have, dearest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That which draws me to it and makes me happy
to go,&#8221; she said in a whisper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>&#8220;Ah, our love. To last, please God, until life&#8217;s
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath, pressed closer to me, sighed
and then smiled as she repeated in a whisper of prayerful
earnestness: &#8220;Until life&#8217;s end.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then we stood together in silence too happy
for words, until the yacht had turned out of the river
mouth and the city was hidden from view.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
